<p>Please read the terms and conditions shown below and click on the “I
agree” button at the bottom of this page to continue. Terms and
Conditions</p>
<p>Welcome to the Vocareum, Inc. (“Vocareum”) website located at
www.vocareum.com (the “Site”). Please read these Terms of Service (the
“Terms”) and our Privacy Policy (
http://www.vocareum.com/privacy-policy/ ) carefully because they govern
your use of our Site and our web-based education and learning platform.
To make these Terms easier to read, the Site and our platform are
collectively called the “Services.”</p>
<p>Using the functionality of our Services, teachers can create,
customize and administer educational courses and invite students to
participate in a class taught and supervised by the teacher using the
online tools provided by Vocareum. Subject to your compliance with these
Terms, Vocareum will make the Services available to you solely for the
purpose of your internal, non-commercial use.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Agreement to Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you
don’t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are
accessing and using the Services on behalf of an educational institution
(such as your employer or the educational institution in which you are
enrolled) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have
the authority to bind that educational institution or other legal entity
to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that
educational institution or other legal entity</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Changes to Terms or Services</li>
</ol>
<p>We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do
so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site
or through other communications. The effective date of the modified
Terms will be indicated in the modified Terms and any such other
communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we
modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have
posted modified Terms on the Site or otherwise communicated with you
about the modified Terms, you are indicating to us that you agree to be
bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the
modified Terms, then you may no longer use the Services. Because our
Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any
part of the Services, at any time and without notice to you, at our sole
discretion</p>

your parent or legal guardian) and are not barred from using the
Services under applicable law.</p>
<p>Registration and Your Information If you want to use certain features
of the Services you’ll have to create an account (“Account”). If you are
a student, your teacher will have already created your Account for you.
It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and
up-to-date information for your Account (and your students’ Accounts, if
you are a teacher) and you agree to update such information, as needed,
to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might
have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t
disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us
immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible
for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you
know about them. If you are a student and want to correct your Account

</ol>
<p>NEITHER VOCAREUM NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING,
OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES OR CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS,
LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR
SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE
SERVICES OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND
WHETHER OR NOT VOCAREUM HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE
FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THE USER WHO
SUBMITTED USER CONTENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USER CONTENT IN QUESTION

<p>IN NO EVENT WILL VOCAREUM’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN

NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO VOCAREUM, AS APPLICABLE.</p>
<p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN VOCAREUM AND
YOU.</p>
<p>Dispute Resolution</p>
<p>Governing Law These Terms and any action related thereto will be
governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its
conflict of laws provisions.</p>
<p>Agreement to Arbitrate</p>
<p>You and Vocareum agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising
out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the
Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by
binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to
bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action
described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”).
Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to
litigate any other Dispute if you provide Vocareum with written notice
of your desire to do so by email or regular mail at Vocareum, Inc, 3031
Tische Way, San Jose, CA 95128 within thirty (30) days following the
date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out
Notice”). If you don’t provide Vocareum with an Arbitration Opt-out
Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have
knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute
except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action, or, if you
timely provide Vocareum with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the
state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California
and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and
venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Vocareum with an
Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and
Vocareum are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate
as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or
representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Vocareum
otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than
one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any
class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held
unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section
will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this
“Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these
Terms.</p>
<p>Arbitration Rules</p>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration
Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA
Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution”
section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by
calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will
govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
<p>Arbitration Process</p>
<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other
party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration and a separate
Demand for Arbitration for California residents. The arbitrator will be
either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will
be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the
parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of
delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the
arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>Arbitration Location and Procedure Unless you and Vocareum otherwise
agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.
If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be
conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Vocareum
submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator
determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000,
your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to
the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a
reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p>Arbitrator’s Decision The arbitrator will render an award within the
time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will
include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator
based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages
must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability”
section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party
may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive
relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to
provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you
prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’
fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Vocareum
will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable
law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in
arbitration.</p>
<p>Fees Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and
arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However,
if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Vocareum will pay all
such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your
claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous
or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p>Changes</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services”
section above, if Vocareum changes this “Dispute Resolution” section
after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any
subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by
sending us written notice (including by email to www.Vocareum.com)
within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in
the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Vocareum’s email to you
notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing
that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Vocareum in
accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as
of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent
changes to these Terms).</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>General Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
agreement between Vocareum and you regarding the Services and Content,
and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written
understandings or agreements between Vocareum and you regarding the
Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or
unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms
of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent
jurisdiction, if you opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration
Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that
provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the
other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
effect.</p>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or
otherwise, without Vocareum’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you
to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
Vocareum may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit
of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>Any notices or other communications provided by Vocareum under these
Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be
given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices
made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which
such notice is transmitted.</p>
<p>Vocareum’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver
of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
signed by a duly authorized representative of Vocareum. Except as
expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any
of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
