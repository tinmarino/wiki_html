I just wrote this now in response to an email sent to me asking how
I did my ASCII artwork.  I responded by writing a brief walkthrough
of my thought processes (well, kind of) and just wanted to share
them on the group.  Let&#39;s see more people try to make create their
own new artwork instead of requesting for the old stuff all the
time.  It&#39;ll make for a better newsgroup overall and everyone will
benefit!  -- Daniel

= ASCII art tips and example ==

Try practicing to make your own artwork by just typing on the
keyboard, which is what I do (I work just using the DOS text editor
which comes along with any MSDOS machine.  Any text editor will do.)
Begin by basic shapes.  For example, if you&#39;re making an animal -
say a giraffe - let&#39;s start with the head:

                     __.ii,
                    (__,&quot; |
                        | |

basically simple shapes to make it look approximately like it does
in real life (as best as you can, at least, in this case I&#39;ve
cartooned it a bit :-) The &quot; is making up the eyes, the . and , the
ears and a smile.  The i i are those antennae like things on top of
their heads (if I remember correctly).  I usually like to keep my
artwork within the size of a screen.  Since a giraffe is a tall
animal, I&#39;m keeping the details smaller.  Then continue on with the
body and some legs.  Try to do a rough outline.

                     __.ii,
                    (__,&quot; |
                        | |
                        | |
                        | |
                        | |
                        | |
                        | |------------,
                       /               \\
                       |                |\
                       |,._  |,______\ |||
                       || //&#39;     ||  || |
                       || ((      ||  || |
                       || `\\     ||  || M
                       ||   \\    ||  ||
                      /_|   /_|  /_| /_|

It&#39;s best to add some . and , in order to smooth out some of the
edges.  Then the tail is in the back.  Then add the detail - hair on
the neck and spots on the body.

                     __.ii,
                    (__,&quot; |%
                        | #%
                        | |%
                        | #%
                        # |%
                        | |%
                        | |%-----------,
                       / ###  #####    \\
                       |####   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; ### |\
                       |,._  |,_###__\ |||
                       || //&#39;     ||  || |
                       || ((      ||  || |
                       || `\\     ||  || M
                       ||   \\    ||  ||
                      /_|   /_|  /_| /_|  dcau

That&#39;s pretty much for a quick giraffe that I just did while writing
this letter.  You can add more stuff like a tree and a bird on a
branch too:


              O  )    __.ii,           \ | /
       O          )  (__,&quot; |%         - (_) -
  O              )       | #%          / | \
                )        | |%
   O          )          | #%
          O )            # |%
        ,~               | |%
-- ~| ~   `O&gt;            | |------------,
    |  ||_&lt;/)__         / ###  #####    \\
    | //&#39;/&quot;&quot;            |####   &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; ### |\
    //                  |,._  |,_###__\ |||     A quick sketch of a
    |                   || //&#39;     ||  || |     tree, bird, and giraffe
D   |                   || ((      ||  || |        by Daniel C. Au (dcau)
 C  |                   ||  \\     ||  || M
  A |                   ||   \\    ||  ||
   U \_,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/_|,,,/_|,,/_|,/_|,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How&#39;s that for a happy little scene? :-)  I etched my initials on
the bottom of the tree. *grin*

Just practice and practice and you&#39;ll get the hang of it.  Try to
learn techniques from other people&#39;s artwork (Felix Lee&#39;s cats are a
good example).  It&#39;ll help you learn how to orientate yourself and
how to best use some of the characters.  Hope it goes well for
everyone.  Let&#39;s see some more creative activity on the newsgroup.
You _can_ do it!

Regards,
Daniel
