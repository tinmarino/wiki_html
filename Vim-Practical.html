Tip 28. Execute a Command on One or More Consecutive Lines
Tip 29. Duplicate or Move Lines Using ‘:t’ and ‘:m’ Commands
    :/&lt;html&gt;/+1,/&lt;\/html&gt;/-1p
    `@:`                    &quot; Repeat ex command
Tip 30. Run Normal Mode Commands Across a Range
Tip 31. Repeat the Last Ex Command
    Before executing the specified Normal mode command on each line, Vim
        moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
    :normal .               &quot; for simple repeats or
    :normal @q              &quot; for more complex tasks
Tip 32. Tab-Complete Your Ex Commands
    :h wildmenu
    &lt;Tab&gt; , &lt;C-n&gt; , or &lt;Right&gt;
    &lt;S-Tab&gt; , &lt;C-p&gt; , or &lt;Left&gt;
Tip 33. Insert the Current Word at the Command Prompt
    &lt;C-r&gt;&lt;C-w&gt;              &quot; copies the word under the
                            &quot; cursor and inserts it at the command-line prompt
    &lt;C-r&gt;&lt;C-a&gt;              &quot; WORD
Tip 34. Recall Commands from History
    cnoremap &lt;C-p&gt; &lt;Up&gt;     &quot; To filter the command histroy 
    cnoremap &lt;C-n&gt; &lt;Down&gt;   &quot; by the prefix of cmdline
    q/
    q:
    :&lt;C-f&gt;

Tip 35. Run Commands in the Shell
    :h cmdline-special      &quot; Like % for current file
    :write !sh              &quot; Each line executed in shell
    :h reaname-files        &quot; For and example
    !{motion}               &quot; Go to cmdmode prepopulate with lines of motion

Tip 57. Jump to the Filename Under the Cursor
    :suffixesadd            &quot; To add a suffix vim will put to the files

    &lt;C-]&gt;                   &quot; Jump to tag
Tip 58. Snap Between Files Using Global Marks
    Try to get into a habit of setting a global mark before using any commands
    that interact with the quickfix list, such as :grep , :vimgrep , and :make
    . The same goes for the commands that interact with the buffer and
    argument lists, such as :args {arglist} and :argdo</code></pre>
<h1 id="iv-registers">IV REGISTERS</h1>
<h3 id="copy-and-paste">10. Copy and Paste</h3>
<pre><code>Tip 59. Delete, Yank, and Put with Vim’s Unnamed Register
    xp  &quot; Transpose the next two characters.
Tip 60. Grok Vim’s Registers
    :delete c
    :put c
Tip 61. Replace a Visual Selection with a Register
    When we use the p command in Visual mode, Vim replaces the selection with
    the contents of the specified register
Tip 62. Paste from a Register
    {start} |I like chips and fish.
    `fc`      I like |chips and fish.
    de      I like |and fish.
    mm      I like |and fish.
    ww      I like and |fish.
    ve      I like and |fish.
    p       I like and |chips.
    `m      I like |and chips.
    P       I like fish |and chips.
    gp and gP   &quot; leave the cursor positioned at the end of the pasted text
                &quot; instead of at the beginning
Tip 63. Interact with the System Clipboard
    GVim is able to discern when text is pasted from the clipboard and adjust its
        behavior accordingly, but when Vim runs inside a terminal this information
        is not available. The ‘paste’ option allows us to manually warn Vim that we’re
        about to use the system paste command. When the ‘paste’ option is enabled,
        Vim turns off all Insert mode mappings and abbreviations and resets a host
        of options, including ‘autoindent’ (look up :h &#39;paste&#39; for the full list).
        That allows us to safely paste from the system clipboard with no surprises. 
    Avoid Toggling ‘paste’ by Putting from the Plus Register</code></pre>
<h3 id="macros">11. Macros</h3>
<pre><code>Tip 64. Record and Execute a Macro
Tip 65. Normalize, Strike, Abort
    The golden rule is this: when recording a macro, ensure that every command
        is repeatable.
    Where am I, where have I come from, and where am I going?
Tip 66. Play Back with a Count
Tip 67. Repeat a Change on Contiguous Lines
    :&#39;&lt;,&#39;&gt;normal @a
Tip 68. Append Commands to a Macro
Tip 69. Act Upon a Collection of Files
    :args
    :first, :last, :prev, and :next
    :argdo normal @a
Tip 70. Evaluate an Iterator to Number Items in a List
    i&lt;C-r&gt;=i&gt;CR&gt;    &quot; insert the value stored in variable i
Tip 71. Edit the Contents of a Macro
    The :put command, on the other hand, always pastes below the
        current line, whether the specified register contains a line-wise or a
        character-wise set of text.
    &quot;add  &quot; Bad: contains the new line
    &quot;ay$  &quot; Good: 
    :let @a=substitute(@a, &#39;\~&#39;, &#39;vU&#39;, &#39;g&#39;)</code></pre>

Tip 73. Use the \v Pattern Switch for Regex Searches
Tip 74. Use the \V Literal Switch for Verbatim Searches
Tip 75. Use Parentheses to Capture Submatches
Tip 76. Stake the Boundaries of a Word
    g* and g# variants perform the same searches without word delimiters.
Tip 77. Stake the Boundaries of a Match
Tip 78. Escape Problem Characters
    When searching backward, the ? symbol acts as the search field
        terminator.  That means we don’t have to escape / characters
    call escape(@u, &#39;/\&#39;), which would prefix each / and \ character with a
        backslash. If we were searching backward, we could instead call
        escape(@u, &#39;?\&#39;).
    =escape(@u, getcmdtype().&#39;\&#39;)</code></pre>

<h3 id="substitution">14. Substitution</h3>
<pre><code>Tip 87. Meet the Substitute Command
Tip 88. Find and Replace Every Match in a File
Tip 89. Eyeball Each Substitution
Tip 90. Reuse the Last Search Pattern
Tip 91. Replace with the Contents of a Register
    :%s//\=@0/g
Tip 92. Repeat the Previous Substitute Command
    g&amp; is like :%s//~/&amp;        &quot;Replace in all file 

    :&amp;&amp; The :&amp;&amp; command requires some explanation, since the first and second
        &amp; symbols have different meanings. The first one forms the :&amp; Ex
        command, which repeats the last :substitute command (see :h :&amp; ),
        while the second one indicates that the flags from the previous :s
        command should be reused.
    :%&amp;&amp; = g&amp;
    &amp; The &amp; command is a synonym for :s, which repeats the last
        substitution. Unfortunately, if any flags were used, the &amp; command
        disregards them, meaning that the outcome could be quite different
        from the previous substitution.  Making &amp; trigger the :&amp;&amp; command is
        more useful. It preserves flags and therefore produces more consistent
        results. These mappings fix the &amp; command in Normal mode and create a
        Visual mode equivalent:
        nnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;CR&gt;
        xnoremap &amp; :&amp;&amp;&lt;CR&gt;
Tip 93. Rearrange CSV Fields Using Submatches
Tip 94. Perform Arithmetic on the Replacement
    :%s//\=submatch(0)-1/g
Tip 95. Swap Two or More Words
Tip 96. Find and Replace Across Multiple Files
    :args **/*.txt
    :set hidden

<h3 id="index-and-navigate-source-code-with-ctags">16. Index and Navigate Source Code with ctags</h3>
<pre><code>Tip 101. Meet ctags
    Keywords Are Addressed by Pattern, Not by Line Number
    The specification for the tags file format states that the address
        could be any Ex command
    ctags uses the search command to address each keyword (if you’re not
        convinced that search is an Ex command, try entering :/pattern).
Tip 102. Configure Vim to Work with ctags
    The |tags| option specifies where Vim should look to find a tags file 
    tags=./tags,tags
    With these settings, Vim looks for a tags file in the directory of the
        current file and in the working directory.
    :!ctags -R
    In “Effortless Ctags with Git,” Tim Pope demonstrates how to set up hooks
        for the post-commit , post-merge, and post-checkout events.
Tip 103. Navigate Keyword Definitions with Vim’s Tag Navigation Commands
    Also, these Ex commands can accept a regular expression when used in
            the form :tag /{pattern} or :tjump /{pattern}
    &lt;C-]&gt;               Jump to the first tag that matches the word under the cursor
    &lt;C-t&gt;
    g&lt;C-]&gt;              Prompt user to select from multiple matches for the word
                            under the cursor. If only one match exists, jump to it
                            without prompting.
    :tag {keyword}      Jump to the first tag that matches {keyword}
    :tjump {keyword}    Prompt user to select from multiple matches for {keyword}.
                            If only one match exists, jump to it without prompting.
    :pop or &lt;C-t&gt;       Reverse through tag history
    :tag                Advance through tag history
    :tnext              Jump to next matching tag
    :tprev              Jump to previous matching tag
    :tfirst             Jump to first matching tag

Tip 109. Customize the grep Program
Tip 110. Grep with Vim’s Internal Search Engine
    :vim[grep][!] /{pattern}/[g][j] {file} ...
    When multiple matches are on the same line, the presence of the g flag
        creates a match for each one of them. Without it, only a single record
        is created for the entire line. By default, Vim will jump straight to
        the first match, but you can prevent this by including the j flag.a
    The * wildcard will match any file in a directory. The ** wildcard matches
        any file in the specified directory or any of its subdirectories.
        Additionally, we can use the ## symbol, which is expanded to represent
        the names of each file in the argument list</code></pre>
<h3 id="dial-x-for-autocompletion">19. Dial X for Autocompletion</h3>
<pre><code>Tip 111. Meet Vim’s Keyword Autocompletion

    &lt;C-n&gt;    Use the next match from the word list (next match)
    &lt;C-p&gt;    Use the previous match from the word list (previous match)

Tip 113. Understand the Source of Keywords
    Vim understands the C way of including files, but it can be taught to
        follow the corresponding directives in other languages by tweaking the
        |include| setting. This should be from a plugin
    set include?
