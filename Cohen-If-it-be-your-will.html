<p>If it be your will That I speak no more And my voice be still As it was before I will speak no more I shall abide until I am spoken for If it be your will</p>
<p>If it be your will That a voice be true From this broken hill I will sing to you From this broken hill All your praises they shall ring If it be your will To let me sing (bis last 4)</p>
<p>If it be your will If there is a choice Let the rivers fill Let the hills rejoice Let your mercy spill On all these burning hearts in hell If it be your will To make us well</p>
<p>And draw us near And bind us tight All your children here In their rags of light In our rags of light All dressed to kill And end this night If it be your will</p>
