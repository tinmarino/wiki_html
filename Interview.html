<p>Here is a list of 100 advanced questions on data structures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What is a trie data structure? Answer: A trie is a tree-like data
structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are usually
strings.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a B-tree data structure? Answer: A B-tree is a
self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows
searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic
time.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a hash table data structure? Answer: A hash table is a
data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function that
computes an index into an array of buckets or slots.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a segment tree data structure? Answer: A segment tree is
a tree data structure used for range queries and updates on an array or
a list.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a skip list data structure? Answer: A skip list is a
probabilistic data structure used for fast searching, insertion, and
deletion operations.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a Fibonacci heap data structure? Answer: A Fibonacci heap
is a heap data structure used for priority queue operations that
provides amortized constant-time operations.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a red-black tree data structure? Answer: A red-black tree
is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure that ensures
logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a AVL tree data structure? Answer: An AVL tree is a
self-balancing binary search tree data structure that ensures
logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a splay tree data structure? Answer: A splay tree is a
self-adjusting binary search tree data structure that adjusts itself
after every operation to optimize future access.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a Fenwick tree data structure? Answer: A Fenwick tree,
also known as a binary indexed tree, is a data structure used to perform
efficient range queries and updates on an array or a list.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a rope data structure? Answer: A rope is a binary tree
data structure used for efficiently storing and manipulating large
string data.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a suffix array data structure? Answer: A suffix array is
a data structure that stores all the suffixes of a string in
lexicographical order.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a bloom filter data structure? Answer: A bloom filter is
a probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a
member of a set.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a k-d tree data structure? Answer: A k-d tree is a binary
search tree data structure used for efficient range searches and nearest
neighbor searches in a k-dimensional space.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a van Emde Boas tree data structure? Answer: A van Emde
Boas tree is a tree data structure used for fast operations on sets of
integers.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a quadtree data structure? Answer: A quadtree is a tree
data structure used to partition two-dimensional space by recursively
subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a octree data structure? Answer: An octree is a tree data
structure used to partition three-dimensional space by recursively
subdividing it into eight octants or regions.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a rope data structure? Answer: A rope is a data structure
used for efficiently storing and manipulating large strings.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a suffix tree data structure? Answer: A suffix tree is a
data structure used to store all the suffixes of a string in a compact
form.</p></li>
<li><p>What is a Cartesian tree data structure? Answer: A Cartesian tree
is a binary tree data structure used for efficiently solving range
minimum query problems.</p></li>
