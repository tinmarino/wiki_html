<p>War is the continuation of policy (politics) by other means. If you entrench yourself behind strong fortifications, you compel the enemy to seek a solution elsewhere. Never forget that no military leader has ever become great without audacity. If the leader is filled with high ambition and if he pursues his aims with audacity and strength of will, he will reach them in spite of all obstacles. - Karl von Clausewitz</p>
<h1 id="principles-of-war-propaganda">Principles of War Propaganda</h1>
<p>In 2001 (before 9/11), Belgian historian Anne Morelli (fr) published a book analyzing the basic principles of war propaganda. She credits the work of Lord Ponsonby, an amazing and unfortunately somewhat forgotten character. He stood, largely alone, in the Commons opposing WWI before it started, predicting not just the massacre it was going to be, but more interestingly for our purpose, how it was going to be sold to the masses. Morelli enumerates it as the following principles: 1. We don’t want war, we are only defending ourselves 2. The other guy is the sole responsible for this war 3. Our adversary’s leader is evil and looks evil 4. We are defending a noble purpose, not special interest 5. The enemy is purposefully causing atrocities; we only commit mistakes 6. The enemy is using unlawful weapons 7. We have very little losses, the enemy is losing big 8. Intellectuals and artists support our cause 9. Our cause is sacred 10. Those who doubt our propaganda are traitors. }</p>
<h1 id="principles-of-warfare">Principles of Warfare</h1>
<p>Confusion: Make it so they do not know which way to turn. Demoralization: Make it so they do not want to fight. Disabling: Removing enemy capability. Discipline: Train your troops. Division: Divide and conquer. Distraction: Make them look the other way. Erosion: Wear them down. Fear: Make it so they are afraid to fight you. Generosity: Be kind to them so they are kind in return. Intelligence: The side that knows most wins. Overwhelm: Show and use far greater force. Provocation: Make them angry so they act impetuously. Sacrifice: Pay a high price for a high return. Seamlessness: Present no chink in your armor. Speed: Be quicker than them. Be able to react fast.</p>
