<pre><code>* Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines</code></pre>
<h1 id="imperative">Imperative</h1>
<p>In which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state, * procedural which groups instructions into procedures, * object-oriented which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,</p>
<h1 id="declarative">Declarative</h1>
<p>In which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it. * Markup, Regex, Query (SQL) * functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications, * logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules, * mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem * Symbolic programming is a paradigm that describes programs able to manipulate formulas and program components as data (Lisp, Prolog)</p>
<h1 id="more">More</h1>
<pre><code>* litterate documentation is integral to the program, and the program is structured following the logic of prose exposition, rather than compiler convenience.
* Process-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that separates the concerns of data structures and the concurrent processes that act upon them</code></pre>
