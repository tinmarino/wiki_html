<h4>Question</h4>
<p>The first thing to say is that this is not the same as the question about interesting mathematical mistakes. I am interested about the type of false beliefs that many intelligent people have while they are learning mathematics, but quickly abandon when their mistake is pointed out – and also in why they have these beliefs. So in a sense I am interested in commonplace mathematical mistakes.</p>
<p>Let me give a couple of examples to show the kind of thing I mean. When teaching complex analysis, I often come across people who do not realize that they have four incompatible beliefs in their heads simultaneously. These are</p>

<p>Obviously, it is (ii) that is false. I think probably many people visualize the extension of <span class="math inline">\(\sin z\)</span> to the complex plane as a doubly periodic function, until someone points out that that is complete nonsense.</p>
<p>A second example is the statement that an open dense subset <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> must be the whole of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. The “proof” of this statement is that every point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is arbitrarily close to a point <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, so when you put a small neighbourhood about <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> it must contain <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since I’m asking for a good list of examples, and since it’s more like a psychological question than a mathematical one, I think I’d better make it community wiki. The properties I’d most like from examples are that they are from reasonably advanced mathematics (so I’m less interested in very elementary false statements like <span class="math inline">\((x+y)^2=x^2+y^2\)</span>, even if they are widely believed) and that the reasons they are found plausible are quite varied.</p>

<p>Many students believe that 1 plus the product of the first <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> primes is always a prime number. They have misunderstood the contradiction in Euclid’s proof that there are infinitely many primes. (By the way, <span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 + 1\)</span> is not prime and there are many other such examples.)</p>

<p><b>Much much later edit:</b> Euclid’s proof is not not by contradiction. This is another very widespread false belief. It depends on personal opinion and interpretation what a proof by contradiction is and whether Euclid’s proof belongs to this category. In fact, if the derivation of an absurdity or the contradiction of an assumption is a proof by contradiction, then Euclid’s proof <em>is</em> a proof by contradiction. Euclid says (Elements Book 9 Proposition 20): <em>The very thing (is) absurd. Thus, G is not the same as one of A, B, C. And it was assumed (to be) prime.</em></p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 45)</h4>
<p>It’s not that it’s not defined… Actually it has been defined more than it should have. There are plenty of functions that interpolate the factorials, some of them extend to the negative integers as well. Hadamard’s Gamma function is entire, logarithmic single inflected factorial function is another example. But on the other hand, for some mysterious reason, the nice property that we want an extension of the factorial to enjoy is log-convexity. The Bohr-Mollerup-Artin Theorem tells us that the only function which is logarithmically convex on the positive real line and satisfies <span class="math inline">\(f(z)=zf(z-1)\)</span> there (also <span class="math inline">\(f(1)=1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(z)&amp;gt;0\)</span>) is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function">Gamma function</a>. Unfortunately the gamma function doesn’t extend to negative integers, and that is why I guess people don’t really care that much for defining them as they know that no “good” answer can be found.</p>

<p>I think it’s worth pointing out here that, if <span class="math inline">\(a\ge0\)</span>, then, near z = -a, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \Gamma(z) = (-1)^a {1 \over a!} {1 \over {z+a}} + O(1) \]</span></p>
<p>and so it might be tempting to say that, in some sense,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \Gamma(-a) = (-1)^a {1 \over a!} \infty \]</span></p>
<p>where the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> represents the rate at which <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> blows up near the pole at <span class="math inline">\(a = 0\)</span>. That is, <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma(0) = \infty, \Gamma(-1) = -\infty, \Gamma(-2) = \infty/2, \Gamma(-3) = -\infty/6\)</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>In particular, this interpretation might work in some formula in which <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> evaluated at nonpositive integers appears in both the numerator and the denominator, and the symbol <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> can be canceled to yield a real number.</p>

<h3>3: Too old for advanced mathematics? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/7120.html">168920</a> in 2014)</h3>
<section id="question-2" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Kind of an odd question, perhaps, so I apologize in advance if it is inappropriate for this forum. I’ve never taken a mathematics course since high school, and didn’t complete college. However, several years ago I was affected by a serious illness and ended up temporarily disabled. I worked in the music business, and to help pass the time during my convalescence I picked up a book on musical acoustics.</p>
<p>That book reintroduced me to calculus with which I’d had a fleeting encounter with during high school, so to understand what I was reading I figured I needed to brush up, so I picked up a copy of Stewart’s “Calculus”. Eventually I spent more time working through that book than on the original text. I also got a copy of “Differential Equations” by Edwards and Penny after I had learned enough calculus to understand that. I’ve also been learning linear algebra - MIT’s lectures and problem sets have really helped in this area. I’m fascinated with the mathematics of the Fourier transform, particularly its application to music in the form of the DFT and DSP - I’ve enjoyed the lectures that Stanford has available on the topic immensely. I just picked up a little book called “Introduction To Bessel Functions” by Frank Bowman that I’m looking forward to reading.</p>
<p>The difficulty is, I’m 30 years old, and I can tell that I’m a lot slower at this than I would have been if I had studied it at age 18. I’m also starting to feel that I’m getting into material that is going to be very difficult to learn without structure or some kind of instruction - like I’ve picked all the low-hanging fruit and that I’m at the point of diminishing returns. I am fortunate though, that after a lot of time and some great MDs my illness is mostly under control and I now have to decide what to do with “what comes after.”</p>
<p>I feel a great deal of regret, though, that I didn’t discover that I enjoyed this discipline until it was probably too late to make any difference. I <em>am</em> able, however, to return to college now if I so choose.</p>
<p>The questions I’d like opinions on are these: is returning to school at my age for science or mathematics possible? Is it worth it? I’ve had a lot of difficulty finding any examples of people who have gotten their first degrees in science or mathematics at my age. Do such people exist? Or is this avenue essentially forever closed beyond a certain point? If anyone is familiar with older first-time students in mathematics or science - how do they fare?</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-86" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 86)</h4>
<p>This is indeed not a typical math overflow question, but never mind that.</p>
<p>Of course you can learn mathematics at the age of 30 after having stopped studying it at the age of 18! Examples are abundant – in almost every math department I’ve ever been in, there are at least one or two older graduate students that took some years off (after high school, after college or both) and did quite well upon their return.</p>
<p>Being older than 18 may not be a bad thing. Many 18 year-olds are neither well-prepared nor well-motivated to study mathematics (or something else) at the university level: a lot of them are there because their parents want them to be, and most of them are there because their parents are paying.</p>
<p>It is true that essential skills get rusty after years of disuse – when I teach “freshman calculus”, older students often do not do very well, even if “older” means 21 or 22: they’ve forgotten too much precalculus mathematics. But you have been learning about calculus, differential equations and linear algebra on your own and enjoying it! You’re looking forward to reading a book on Bessel functions!! You’re well past the point where older, rusty students have trouble. You can do it, for sure, and it sounds like you want to, so you should.</p>
<p>By the way, 30 is not remotely old. I am a few years older and I think better and more quickly now than I did when I was your age.</p>

<p>Dear bitrex: your enthusiasm is heart-warming!</p>
<p>I have had students much older than you and they have always been a joy to teach: their maturity more than compensated for their potential knowledge-gaps and they fared very well on their exams.</p>
<p>The nicest success story is a professional cellist who didn’t even have the “baccalauréat”, a French diploma for the end of secondary school usually taken at age 18. He started learning math because he had married a math teacher (!) and became an excellent student. He passed his D.E.A. (a sort of undergraduate thesis) brilliantly and unfortunately couldn’t accept my suggestion to do a Ph.D. because of his professional activity ( I sometimes hear him at concerts…).</p>
<p>So my advice is to go on with your mathematics: I can’t predict the future but my feeling is that your age is not very relevant. Good luck!</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-3-score-52" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 52)</h4>
<p>With all this unanimous enthusiasm, I can’t help but add a cautionary note. I will say, however, that what I’m about to say applies to <em>anyone</em> of any age trying to get a Ph.D. and pursue a career as an academic mathematician.</p>
<p>If you think you want a Ph.D. in mathematics, you should first try your best to talk yourself out of it. It’s a little like aspiring to be a pro athlete. Even under the best of circumstances, the chances are too high that you’ll end up in a not-very-well-paying job in a not-very-attractive geographic location. Or, if you insist on living in, say, New York, you may end up teaching as an adjunct at several different places.</p>
<p>Someone with your mathematical talents and skills can often find much more rewarding careers elsewhere.</p>
<p>You should pursue the Ph.D. only if you love learning, doing, and teaching mathematics so much that you can’t bear the thought of doing anything else, so you’re willing to live with the consequences of trying to make a living with one. Or you have an exit strategy should things not work out.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I have a story. When I was at Rice in the mid 80’s, a guy in his 40’s or 50’s came to the math department and told us he really wanted to become a college math teacher. He had always loved math but went into sales(!) and had a very successful career. With enough money stashed away, he wanted to switch to a career in math. To put it mildly, we were really skeptical, mostly because he had the overly cheery outgoing personality of a salesman and therefore was completely unlike anyone else in the math department. It was unthinkable that someone like that could be serious about math. Anyway, we warned him that his goal was probably unrealistic but he was welcome to try taking our undergraduate math curriculum to prepare. Not surprisingly, he found this rather painful, but eventually to our amazement he started to do well in our courses, including all the proofs in analysis. By the end, we told the guy that we thought he really had a shot at getting a Ph.D. and have a modest career as a college math teacher. He thanked us but told us that he had changed his mind. As much as he loved doing the math, it was a solitary struggle and took too much of his time away from his family and friends. In the end, he chose them over a career in math (which of course was a rather shocking choice to us).</p>
<p>So if you really want to do math and can afford to live with the consequences, by all means go for it.</p>

<section id="question-3" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>When I was a young and impressionable graduate student at Princeton, we scared each other with the story of a Final Public Oral, where Jack Milnor was dragged in against his will to sit on a committee, and noted that the class of topological spaces discussed by the speaker consisted of finite spaces. I had assumed this was an “urban legend”, but then at a cocktail party, I mentioned this to a faculty member, who turned crimson and said that this was one of his students, who never talked to him, and then had to write another thesis (in numerical analysis, which was not very highly regarded at Princeton at the time). But now, I have talked to a couple of topologists who should have been there at the time of the event, and they told me that this was an urban legend at their time as well, so maybe the faculty member was pulling my leg.</p>
<p>
So, the questions are: (a) any direct evidence for or against this particular disaster? (b) what stories kept <strong>you</strong> awake at night as a graduate student, and is there any evidence for or against their truth?
</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> (this is unrelated, but I don’t want to answer my own question too many times): At Princeton, there was supposedly an FPO in Physics, on some sort of statistical mechanics, and the constant <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> appeared many times. The student was asked:</p>
<p>Examiner: What is <span class="math inline">\(k?\)</span></p>
<p>Student: Boltzmann’s constant.</p>
<p>Examiner: Yes, but what is the value?</p>
<p>Student: Gee, I don’t know…</p>
<p>Examiner: OK, order of magnitude?</p>
<p>Student: Umm, don’t know, I just know <span class="math inline">\(k\dots\)</span></p>
<p>The student was failed, since he was obviously not a physicist.</p>

<p>This happened just last year, but it certainly deserves to be included in the annals of mathematical legends:</p>
<p>A graduate student (let’s call him Saeed) is in the airport standing in a security line. He is coming back from a conference, where he presented some exciting results of his Ph.D. thesis in Algebraic Geometry. One of the people whom he met at his presentation (let’s call him Vikram) is also in the line, and they start talking excitedly about the results, and in particular the clever solution to problem X via <strong>blowing up eight points on a plane</strong>.</p>
<p>They don’t notice other travelers slowly backing away from them.</p>
<p>Less than a minute later, the TSA officers descend on the two mathematicians, and take them away. They are thoroughly and intimately searched, and separated for interrogation. For an hour, the interrogation gets nowhere: the mathematicians simply don’t know what the interrogators are talking about. What bombs? What plot? What terrorism?</p>
<p>The student finally realizes the problem, pulls out a pre-print of his paper, and proceeds to explain to the interrogators exactly what “blowing up points on a plane” means in Algebraic Geometry.</p>

<p>Since this has become a free-for-all, allow me to share an anecdote that I wouldn’t quite believe if I hadn’t seen it myself.</p>
<p>I attended graduate school in Connecticut, where seminars proceeded with New England gentility, very few questions coming from the audience even at the end. But my advisor Fred Linton would take me down to New York each week to attend Eilenberg’s category theory seminars at Columbia. These affairs would go on for hours with many interruptions, particularly from Sammy who would object to anything said in less than what he regarded as the optimal way. Now Fred had a tendency to doze off during talks. One particular week a well-known category theorist (but I’ll omit his name) was presenting some of his new results, and Sammy was giving him a very hard time. He kept saying “draw the right diagram, draw the right diagram.” Sammy didn’t know what diagram he wanted and he rejected half a dozen attempts by the speaker, and then at least an equal number from the audience. Finally, when it all seemed a total impasse, Sammy, after a weighty pause said “Someone, wake up Fred.” So someone tapped Fred on the shoulder, he blinked his eyes and Sammy said, in more measured tones than before, “Fred, draw the right diagram.” Fred looked up at the board, walked up, drew the right diagram, returned to his chair, and promptly went back to sleep. And so the talk continued.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your indulgence - I’ve always wanted to see that story preserved for posterity and now I have.</p>

<h3>6: Intuitive crutches for higher dimensional thinking (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/25983.html">128841</a> in 2016)</h3>
<section id="question-5" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I once heard a joke (not a great one I’ll admit…) about higher dimensional thinking that went as follows-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician are discussing how to visualise four dimensions:</p>
<p><em>Engineer</em>: I never really get it</p>
<p><em>Physicist</em>: Oh it’s really easy, just imagine three dimensional space over a time- that adds your fourth dimension.</p>
<em>Mathematician</em>: No, it’s way easier than that; just imagine <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> then set n equal to 4.
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if you’ve ever come across anything manifestly four dimensional (as opposed to 3+1 dimensional) like the linking of 2 spheres, it becomes fairly clear that what the physicist is saying doesn’t cut the mustard- or, at least, needs some more elaboration as it stands.</p>
<p>The mathematician’s answer is abstruse by the design of the joke but, modulo a few charts and bounding 3-folds, it certainly seems to be the dominant perspective- at least in published papers. The situation brings to mind the old Von Neumann quote about “…you never understand things. You just get used to them”, and perhaps that really is the best you can do in this situation.</p>
<p>But one of the principal reasons for my interest in geometry is the additional intuition one gets from being in a space a little like one’s own and it would be a shame to lose that so sharply, in the way that the engineer does, in going beyond 3 dimensions.</p>
<p>What I am looking for, from this uncountably wise and better experienced than I community of mathematicians, is a crutch- anything that makes it easier to see, for example, the linking of spheres- be that simple tricks, useful articles or esoteric (but, hopefully, ultimately useful) motivational diagrams: anything to help me be better than the engineer.</p>
<p>Community wiki rules apply- one idea per post etc.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 125)</h4>
<p>I can’t help you much with high-dimensional topology - it’s not my field, and I’ve not picked up the various tricks topologists use to get a grip on the subject - but when dealing with the geometry of high-dimensional (or infinite-dimensional) vector spaces such as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^n\)</span>, there are plenty of ways to conceptualise these spaces that do not require visualising more than three dimensions directly.</p>
<p>For instance, one can view a high-dimensional vector space as a state space for a system with many degrees of freedom. A megapixel image, for instance, is a point in a million-dimensional vector space; by varying the image, one can explore the space, and various subsets of this space correspond to various classes of images.</p>
<p>One can similarly interpret sound waves, a box of gases, an ecosystem, a voting population, a stream of digital data, trials of random variables, the results of a statistical survey, a probabilistic strategy in a two-player game, and many other concrete objects as states in a high-dimensional vector space, and various basic concepts such as convexity, distance, linearity, change of variables, orthogonality, or inner product can have very natural meanings in some of these models (though not in all).</p>
<p>It can take a bit of both theory and practice to merge one’s intuition for these things with one’s spatial intuition for vectors and vector spaces, but it can be done eventually (much as after one has enough exposure to measure theory, one can start merging one’s intuition regarding cardinality, mass, length, volume, probability, cost, charge, and any number of other “real-life” measures).</p>
<p>For instance, the fact that most of the mass of a unit ball in high dimensions lurks near the boundary of the ball can be interpreted as a manifestation of the law of large numbers, using the interpretation of a high-dimensional vector space as the state space for a large number of trials of a random variable.</p>
<p>More generally, many facts about low-dimensional projections or slices of high-dimensional objects can be viewed from a probabilistic, statistical, or signal processing perspective.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 89)</h4>
<p>Here are some of the crutches I’ve relied on. (Admittedly, my crutches are probably much more useful for theoretical computer science, combinatorics, and probability than they are for geometry, topology, or physics. On a related note, I personally have a much easier time thinking about <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span> than about, say, <span class="math inline">\(R^4\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(R^5\)</span>!)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
If you’re trying to visualize some 4D phenomenon P, first think of a related <i>3D</i> phenomenon P’, and then imagine yourself as a <i>2D</i> being who’s trying to visualize P’. The advantage is that, unlike with the 4D vs. 3D case, <i>you yourself</i> can easily switch between the 3D and 2D perspectives, and can therefore get a sense of exactly what information is being lost when you drop a dimension. (You could call this the “<i>Flatland</i> trick,” after the most famous literary work to rely on it.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As someone else mentioned, discretize! Instead of thinking about <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span>, think about the Boolean hypercube <span class="math inline">\(\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace ^n\)</span>, which is finite and usually easier to get intuition about. (When working on problems, I often find myself drawing <span class="math inline">\(\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace ^4\)</span> on a sheet of paper by drawing two copies of <span class="math inline">\(\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace ^3\)</span> and then connecting the corresponding vertices.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Instead of thinking about a subset <span class="math inline">\(S \subseteq R^n\)</span>, think about its characteristic function <span class="math inline">\(f : R^n \rightarrow \lbrace 0,1 \rbrace\)</span>. I don’t know why that trivial perspective switch makes such a big difference, but it does … maybe because it shifts your attention to the process of <i>computing</i> <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and makes you forget about the hopeless task of visualizing S!
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
One of the central facts about <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span> is that, while it has “room” for only <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> orthogonal vectors, it has room for <span class="math inline">\(\exp(n)\)</span> <i>almost</i>-orthogonal vectors. Internalize that one fact, and so many other properties of <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span> (for example, that the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-sphere resembles a “ball with spikes sticking out,” as someone mentioned before) will suddenly seem non-mysterious. In turn, one way to internalize the fact that <span class="math inline">\(R^n\)</span> has so many almost-orthogonal vectors is to internalize Shannon’s theorem that there exist good error-correcting codes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To get a feel for some high-dimensional object, ask questions about the behavior of a <i>process</i> that takes place on that object. For example: if I drop a ball <i>here</i>, which local minimum will it settle into? How long does this random walk on <span class="math inline">\(\lbrace 0,1 \rbrace ^n\)</span> take to mix?

<p>This is a slightly different point, but Vitali Milman, who works in high-dimensional convexity, likes to draw high-dimensional convex bodies in a non-convex way. This is to convey the point that if you take the convex hull of a few points on the unit sphere of R^n, then for large n very little of the measure of the convex body is anywhere near the corners, so in a certain sense the body is a bit like a small sphere with long thin “spikes”.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Mochizuki has recently announced a proof of the ABC conjecture. It is far too early to judge its correctness, but it builds on many years of work by him. Can someone briefly explain the philosophy behind his work and comment on why it might be expected to shed light on questions like the ABC conjecture?</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 172)</h4>
<p>I would have preferred not to comment seriously on Mochizuki’s work before much more thought had gone into the very basics, but judging from the internet activity, there appears to be much interest in this subject, especially from young people. It would obviously be very nice if they were to engage with this circle of ideas, regardless of the eventual status of the main result of interest. That is to say, the current sense of urgency to understand something seems generally a good thing. So I thought I’d give the flimsiest bit of introduction imaginable at this stage. On the other hand, as with many of my answers, there’s the danger I’m just regurgitating common knowlege in a long-winded fashion, in which case, I apologize.</p>
<p>
For anyone who wants to really get going, I recommend as starting point some familiarity with two papers, ‘The Hodge-Arakelov theory of elliptic curves (HAT)’ and ‘The Galois-theoretic Kodaira-Spencer morphism of an elliptic curve (GTKS).’ [It has been noted here and there that the ‘Survey of Hodge Arakelov Theory I,II’ papers might be reasonable alternatives.][I’ve just examined them again, and they really might be the better way to begin.] These papers depart rather little from familiar language, are essential prerequisites for the current series on IUTT, and will take you a long way towards a grasp at least of the motivation behind Mochizuki’s imposing collected works. This was the impression I had from conversations six years ago, and then Mochizuki himself just pointed me to page 10 of IUTT I, where exactly this is explained. The goal of the present answer is to decipher just a little bit those few paragraphs.
</p>
<p>
The beginning of the investigation is indeed the function field case (over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, for simplicity), where one is given a family <span class="math display">\[f:E \rightarrow B\]</span> of elliptic curves over a compact base, best assumed to be semi-stable and non-isotrivial. There is an exact sequence <span class="math display">\[0\rightarrow \omega_E \rightarrow H^1_{DR}(E) \rightarrow H^1(O_E)\rightarrow0,\]</span> which is moved by the logarithmic Gauss-Manin connection of the family. (I hope I will be forgiven for using standard and non-optimal notation without explanation in this note.) That is to say, if <span class="math inline">\(S\subset B\)</span> is the finite set of images of the bad fibers, there is a log connection <span class="math display">\[H^1_{DR}(E) \rightarrow H^1_{DR}(E) \otimes \Omega_B(S),\]</span> which <em>does not preserve</em> <span class="math inline">\(\omega_E\)</span>. This fact is crucial, since it leads to an <span class="math inline">\(O_B\)</span>-linear Kodaira-Spencer map <span class="math display">\[KS:\omega \rightarrow H^1(O_E)\otimes \Omega_B(S),\]</span> and thence to a non-trivial map <span class="math display">\[\omega_E^2\rightarrow \Omega_B(S).\]</span> From this, one easily deduces Szpiro’s inequality: <span class="math display">\[\deg (\omega_E) \leq (1/2)( 2g_B-2+|S|).\]</span> At the most simple-minded level, one could say that Mochizuki’s programme has been concerned with replicating this argument over a number field <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. Since it has to do with differentiation on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which eventually turns into <span class="math inline">\(O_F\)</span>, some philosophical connection to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_1\)</span>-theory begins to appear. I will carry on using the same notation as above, except now <span class="math inline">\(B=Spec(O_F)\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
A large part of HAT is exactly concerned with the set-up necessary to implement this idea, where, roughly speaking, the Galois action has to play the role of the GM connection. Obviously, <span class="math inline">\(G_F\)</span> doesn’t act on <span class="math inline">\(H^1_{DR}(E)\)</span>. But it does act on <span class="math inline">\(H^1_{et}(\bar{E})\)</span> with various coefficients. The comparison between these two structures is the subject of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic Hodge theory, which sadly works only over local fields rather than a global one. But Mochizuki noted long ago that something like <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic Hodge theory should be a key ingredient because over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, the comparison isomorphism <span class="math display">\[H^1_{DR}(E)\simeq H^1(E(\mathbb{C}), \mathbb{Z})\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} O_B\]</span> allows us to completely recover the GM connection by the condition that the topological cohomology generates the flat sections.
</p>
<p>
In order to get a global arithmetic analogue, Mochizuki has to formulate a <em>discrete non-linear</em> version of the comparison isomorphism. What is non-linear? This is the replacement of <span class="math inline">\(H^1_{DR}\)</span> by the universal extension <span class="math display">\[E^{\dagger}\rightarrow E,\]</span> (the moduli space of line bundles with flat connection on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) whose tangent space is <span class="math inline">\(H^1_{DR}\)</span> (considerations of this nature already come up in usual p-adic Hodge theory). What is discrete is the 'etale cohomology, which will just be <span class="math inline">\(E[\ell]\)</span> with global Galois action, where <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> can eventually be large, on the order of the height of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (that is <span class="math inline">\(\deg (\omega_E)\)</span>). The comparison isomorphism in this context takes the following form: <span class="math display">\[\Xi: A_{DR}=\Gamma(E^{\dagger}, L)^{&amp;lt;\ell}\simeq L|E[\ell]\simeq (L|e_{E})\otimes O_{E[\ell]}.\]</span> (I apologize for using the notation <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}\)</span> for the space that Mochizuki denotes by a calligraphic <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. I can’t seem to write calligraphic characters here.) Here, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is a suitably chosen line bundle of degree <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, which can then be pulled back to <span class="math inline">\(E^{\dagger}\)</span>. The inequality refers to the polynomial degree in the fiber direction of <span class="math inline">\(E^{\dagger} \rightarrow E\)</span>. The isomorphism is effected via evaluation of sections at <span class="math display">\[E^{\dagger}[\ell]\simeq E[\ell].\]</span> Finally, <span class="math display">\[ L|E[\ell]\simeq (L|e_{E})\otimes O_{E[\ell]}\]</span> comes from Mumford’s theory of theta functions. The interpretation of the statement is that it gives an isomorphism between the space of functions of some bounded fiber degree on non-linear De Rham cohomology and the space of functions on discrete 'etale cohomology. This kind of statement is entirely due to Mochizuki. One sometimes speaks of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic Hodge theory with finite coefficients, but that refers to a theory that is not only local, but deals with linear De Rham cohomology with finite coefficients.
</p>
<p>
Now for some corrections: As stated, the isomorphism is not true, and must be modified at the places of bad reduction, the places dividing <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, and the infinite places. This correction takes up a substantial portion of the HAT paper. That is, the isomorphism is generically true over <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, but to make it true everywhere, the integral structures must be modified in subtle and highly interesting ways, while one must consider also a comparison of metrics, since these will obviously figure in an arithmetic analogue of Szpiro’s conjecture. The correction at the finite bad places can be interpreted via coordinates near infinity on the moduli stack of elliptic curves as the subtle phenomenon that Mochizuki refers to as ‘Gaussian poles’ (in the coordinate <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>). Since this is a superficial introduction, suffice it to say for now that these Gaussian poles end up being a major obstruction in this portion of Mochizuki’s theory.
</p>
<p>In spite of this, it is worthwhile giving at least a small flavor of Mochizuki’s Galois-theoretic KS map. The point is that <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}\)</span> has a Hodge filtration defined by</p>
<p>$F^rA_{DR}= (E^{}, L)^{ &lt; r} $</p>
<p>
(the direction is unconventional), and <em>this is moved around by the Galois action induced by the comparison isomorphism.</em> So one gets thereby a map <span class="math display">\[G_F\rightarrow Fil (A_{DR})\]</span> into some space of filtrations on <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}\)</span>. This is, in essence, the Galois-theoretic KS map. That, is if we consider the equivalence over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span>-actions and connections, the usual KS map measures the extent to which the GM connection moves around the Hodge filtration. Here, we are measuring the same kind of motion for the <span class="math inline">\(G_F\)</span>-action.
</p>
<p>
This is already very nice, but now comes a very important variant, essential for understanding the motivation behind the IUTT papers. In the paper GTKS, Mochizuki modified this map, producing instead a ‘Lagrangian’ version. That is, he assumed the existence of a Lagrangian Galois-stable subspace <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\subset E[l]\)</span> giving rise to another isomorphism <span class="math display">\[\Xi^{Lag}:A_{DR}^{H}\simeq L\otimes O_{G^{\mu}},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a Lagrangian complement to <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\)</span>, which I believe does not itself need to be Galois stable. <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is acting on the space of sections, again via Mumford’s theory. This can be used to get another KS morphism to filtrations on <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}^{H}\)</span>. But the key point is that
</p>
<p><em><span class="math inline">\(\Xi^{Lag}\)</span>, in contrast to <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span>, is free of the Gaussian poles</em></p>
<p>via an argument I can’t quite remember (If I ever knew).</p>
<p>
At this point, it might be reasonable to see if <span class="math inline">\(\Xi^{Lag}\)</span> contributes towards a version of Szpiro’s inequality (after much work and interpretation), except for one small problem. A subspace like <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\)</span> has no reason to exist in general. This is why GTKS is mostly about the universal elliptic curve over a formal completion near <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> on the moduli stack of elliptic curves, where such a space does exists. What Mochizuki explains on IUTT page 10 is exactly that the scheme-theoretic motivation for IUG was to enable the move to a single elliptic curve over <span class="math inline">\(B=Spec(O_F)\)</span>, via the intermediate case of an elliptic curve ‘in general position’.
</p>
<p>To repeat:</p>
<p>
<em>A good ‘nonsingular’ theory of the KS map over number fields requires a global Galois invariant Lagrangian subspace <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\subset E[l]\)</span>.</em>
</p>
<p>One naive thought might just be to change base to the field generated by the <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-torsion, except one would then lose the Galois action one was hoping to use. (Remember that Szpiro’s inequality is supposed to come from <em>moving</em> the Hodge filtration inside De Rham cohomology.) On the other hand, such a subspace does often exist <em>locally</em>, for example, at a place of bad reduction. So one might ask if there is a way to globally extend such local subspaces.</p>
<p>
It seems to me that this is one of the key things going on in the IUTT papers I-IV. As he say in loc. cit. he works with various categories of collections of local objects that <em>simulate</em> global objects. It is crucial in this process that many of the usual scheme-theoretic objects, local or global, are encoded as suitable categories with a rich and precise combinatorial structure. The details here get very complicated, the encoding of a scheme into an associated Galois category of finite 'etale covers being merely the trivial case. For example, when one would like to encode the Archimedean data coming from an arithmetic scheme (which again, will clearly be necessary for Szpiro’s conjecture), the attempt to come up with a category of about the same order of complexity as a Galois category gives rise to the notion of a <em>Frobenioid</em>. Since these play quite a central role in Mochizuki’s theory, I will quote briefly from his first Frobenioid paper:
</p>
<p>
‘Frobenioids provide a single framework [cf. the notion of a “Galois category”; the role of monoids in log geometry] that allows one to capture the essential aspects of both the Galois and the divisor theory of number fields, on the one hand, and function fields, on the other, in such a way that one may continue to work with, for instance, global degrees of arithmetic line bundles on a number field, but which also exhibits the new phenomenon [not present in the classical theory of number fields] of a “Frobenius endomorphism” of the Frobenioid associated to a number field.’
</p>
<p>
I believe the Frobenioid associated to a number field is something close to the finite 'etale covers of <span class="math inline">\(Spec(O_F)\)</span> (equipped with some log structure) together with metrized line bundles on them, although it’s probably more complicated. The Frobenious endomorphism for a prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is then something like the functor that just raises line bundles to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th power. This is a functor that would come from a map of schemes if we were working in characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, but obviously not in characteristic zero. But this is part of the reason to start encoding in categories:
</p>
<p><em>We get more morphisms and equivalences.</em></p>
<p>
Some of you will notice at this point the analogy to developments in algebraic geometry where varieties are encoded in categories, such as the derived category of coherent sheaves. There as well, one has reconstruction theorems of the Orlov type, as well as the phenomenon of non-geometric morphisms of the categories (say actions of braid groups). Non-geometric morphisms appear to be very important in Mochizuki’s theory, such as the Frobenius above, which allows us to simulate characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> geometry in characteristic zero. Another important illustrative example is a non-geometric isomorphism between Galois groups of local fields (which can’t exist for global fields because of the Neukirch-Uchida theorem). In fact, I think Mochizuki was rather fond of Ihara’s comment that the positive proof of the anabelian conjecture was somewhat of a disappointment, since it destroys the possibility that encoding curves into their fundamental groups will give rise to a richer category. Anyways, I believe the importance of non-geometric maps of categories encoding rather conventional objects is that
</p>
<p>
<em>they allow us to glue together several standard categories in nonstandard ways.</em>
</p>
<p>
Obviously, to play this game well, some things need to be encoded in rigid ways, while others should have more flexible encodings.
</p>
<p>
For a very simple example that gives just a bare glimpse of the general theory, you might consider a category of pairs <span class="math display">\[(G,F),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a profinite topological group of a certain type and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a filtration on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. It’s possible to write down explicit conditions that ensure that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the Galois group of a local field and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is its ramification filtration in the upper numbering (actually, now I think about it, I’m not sure about ‘explicit conditions’ for the filtration part, but anyways). Furthermore, it is a theorem of Mochizuki and Abrashkin that the functor that takes a local field to the corresponding pair is fully faithful. So now, you can consider triples <span class="math display">\[(G,F_1, F_2),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a group and the <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> are <em>two</em> filtrations of the right type. If <span class="math inline">\(F_1=F_2\)</span>, then this ‘is’ just a local field. But now you can have objects with <span class="math inline">\(F_1\neq F_2\)</span>, that correspond to strange amalgams of two local fields.
</p>
<p>
As another example, one might take a usual global object, such as <span class="math display">\[ (E, O_F, E[l], V)\]</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> denotes a collection of valuations of <span class="math inline">\(F(E[l])\)</span> that restrict bijectively to the valuations <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>), and associate to it a collection of local categories indexed by <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> (something like Frobenioids corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(E_v\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v\in V_0\)</span>). One can then try to glue them together in non-standard ways along sub-categories, after performing a number of non-standard transformations. My rough impression at the moment is that the ‘Hodge theatres’ arise in this fashion. [This is undoubtedly a gross oversimplification, which I will correct in later amendments.] You might further imagine that some construction of this sort will eventually retain the data necessary to get the height of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, but also have data corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\)</span>, necessary for the Lagrangian KS map. In any case, I hope you can appreciate that a good deal of ‘dismantling’ and ‘reconstructing,’ what Mochizuki calls <em>surgery</em>, will be necessary.
</p>
<p>
I can’t emphasize enough times that much of what I write is based on faulty memory and guesswork. At best, it is superficial, while at worst, it is (not even) wrong. [<s>In particular, I am no longer sure that the GTKS map is used in an entirely direct fashion.</s>] I have not yet done anything with the current papers than give them a cursory glance. If I figure out more in the coming weeks, I will make corrections. But in the meanwhile, I do hope what I wrote here is mostly more helpful than misleading.
</p>
<p>
Allow me to make one remark about set theory, about which I know next to nothing. Even with more straightforward papers in arithmetic geometry, the question sometimes arises about Grothendieck’s universe axiom, mostly because universes appear to be used in SGA4. Usually, number-theorists (like me) neither understand, nor care about such foundational matters, and questions about them are normally met with a shrug. The conventional wisdom of course is that any of the usual theorems and proofs involving Grothendieck cohomology theories or topoi do not actually rely on the existence of universes, except general laziness allows us to insert some reference that eventually follows a trail back to SGA4. However, this doesn’t seem to be the case with Mochizuki’s paper. That is, universes and interactions between them seem to be important actors rather than conveniences. How this is really brought about, and whether more than the universe axiom is necessary for the arguments, I really don’t understand enough yet to say. In any case, for a number-theorist or an algebraic geometer, I would guess it’s still prudent to acquire a reasonable feel for the ‘usual’ background and motivation (that is, HAT, GTKS, and anabelian things) before worrying too much about deeper issues of set theory.

But Mochizuki noted long ago that something like <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic Hodge theory should be a key ingredient because over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, the comparison isomorphism <span class="math display">\[H^1_{DR}(E)\simeq H^1(E(\mathbb{C}), \mathbb{Z})\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} O_B\]</span> allows us to completely recover the GM connection by the condition that the topological cohomology generates the flat sections.
</p>
<p>
In order to get a global arithmetic analogue, Mochizuki has to formulate a <em>discrete non-linear</em> version of the comparison isomorphism. What is non-linear? This is the replacement of <span class="math inline">\(H^1_{DR}\)</span> by the universal extension <span class="math display">\[E^{\dagger}\rightarrow E,\]</span> (the moduli space of line bundles with flat connection on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) whose tangent space is <span class="math inline">\(H^1_{DR}\)</span> (considerations of this nature already come up in usual p-adic Hodge theory). What is discrete is the 'etale cohomology, which will just be <span class="math inline">\(E[\ell]\)</span> with global Galois action, where <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> can eventually be large, on the order of the height of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> (that is <span class="math inline">\(\deg (\omega_E)\)</span>). The comparison isomorphism in this context takes the following form: <span class="math display">\[\Xi: A_{DR}=\Gamma(E^{\dagger}, L)^{&amp;lt;\ell}\simeq L|E[\ell]\simeq (L|e_{E})\otimes O_{E[\ell]}.\]</span> (I apologize for using the notation <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}\)</span> for the space that Mochizuki denotes by a calligraphic <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. I can’t seem to write calligraphic characters here.) Here, <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is a suitably chosen line bundle of degree <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, which can then be pulled back to <span class="math inline">\(E^{\dagger}\)</span>. The inequality refers to the polynomial degree in the fiber direction of <span class="math inline">\(E^{\dagger} \rightarrow E\)</span>. The isomorphism is effected via evaluation of sections at <span class="math display">\[E^{\dagger}[\ell]\simeq E[\ell].\]</span> Finally, <span class="math display">\[ L|E[\ell]\simeq (L|e_{E})\otimes O_{E[\ell]}\]</span> comes from Mumford’s theory of theta functions. The interpretation of the statement is that it gives an isomorphism between the space of functions of some bounded fiber degree on non-linear De Rham cohomology and the space of functions on discrete 'etale cohomology. This kind of statement is entirely due to Mochizuki. One sometimes speaks of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic Hodge theory with finite coefficients, but that refers to a theory that is not only local, but deals with linear De Rham cohomology with finite coefficients.
</p>
<p>
Now for some corrections: As stated, the isomorphism is not true, and must be modified at the places of bad reduction, the places dividing <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, and the infinite places. This correction takes up a substantial portion of the HAT paper. That is, the isomorphism is generically true over <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, but to make it true everywhere, the integral structures must be modified in subtle and highly interesting ways, while one must consider also a comparison of metrics, since these will obviously figure in an arithmetic analogue of Szpiro’s conjecture. The correction at the finite bad places can be interpreted via coordinates near infinity on the moduli stack of elliptic curves as the subtle phenomenon that Mochizuki refers to as ‘Gaussian poles’ (in the coordinate <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>). Since this is a superficial introduction, suffice it to say for now that these Gaussian poles end up being a major obstruction in this portion of Mochizuki’s theory.
</p>
<p>In spite of this, it is worthwhile giving at least a small flavor of Mochizuki’s Galois-theoretic KS map. The point is that <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}\)</span> has a Hodge filtration defined by</p>
<p>$F^rA_{DR}= (E^{}, L)^{ &lt; r} $</p>
<p>
(the direction is unconventional), and <em>this is moved around by the Galois action induced by the comparison isomorphism.</em> So one gets thereby a map <span class="math display">\[G_F\rightarrow Fil (A_{DR})\]</span> into some space of filtrations on <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}\)</span>. This is, in essence, the Galois-theoretic KS map. That, is if we consider the equivalence over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span>-actions and connections, the usual KS map measures the extent to which the GM connection moves around the Hodge filtration. Here, we are measuring the same kind of motion for the <span class="math inline">\(G_F\)</span>-action.
</p>
<p>
This is already very nice, but now comes a very important variant, essential for understanding the motivation behind the IUTT papers. In the paper GTKS, Mochizuki modified this map, producing instead a ‘Lagrangian’ version. That is, he assumed the existence of a Lagrangian Galois-stable subspace <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\subset E[l]\)</span> giving rise to another isomorphism <span class="math display">\[\Xi^{Lag}:A_{DR}^{H}\simeq L\otimes O_{G^{\mu}},\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is a Lagrangian complement to <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\)</span>, which I believe does not itself need to be Galois stable. <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is acting on the space of sections, again via Mumford’s theory. This can be used to get another KS morphism to filtrations on <span class="math inline">\(A_{DR}^{H}\)</span>. But the key point is that
</p>
<p><em><span class="math inline">\(\Xi^{Lag}\)</span>, in contrast to <span class="math inline">\(\Xi\)</span>, is free of the Gaussian poles</em></p>
<p>via an argument I can’t quite remember (If I ever knew).</p>
<p>
At this point, it might be reasonable to see if <span class="math inline">\(\Xi^{Lag}\)</span> contributes towards a version of Szpiro’s inequality (after much work and interpretation), except for one small problem. A subspace like <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\)</span> has no reason to exist in general. This is why GTKS is mostly about the universal elliptic curve over a formal completion near <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> on the moduli stack of elliptic curves, where such a space does exists. What Mochizuki explains on IUTT page 10 is exactly that the scheme-theoretic motivation for IUG was to enable the move to a single elliptic curve over <span class="math inline">\(B=Spec(O_F)\)</span>, via the intermediate case of an elliptic curve ‘in general position’.
</p>
<p>To repeat:</p>
<p>
<em>A good ‘nonsingular’ theory of the KS map over number fields requires a global Galois invariant Lagrangian subspace <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\subset E[l]\)</span>.</em>
</p>
<p>One naive thought might just be to change base to the field generated by the <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-torsion, except one would then lose the Galois action one was hoping to use. (Remember that Szpiro’s inequality is supposed to come from <em>moving</em> the Hodge filtration inside De Rham cohomology.) On the other hand, such a subspace does often exist <em>locally</em>, for example, at a place of bad reduction. So one might ask if there is a way to globally extend such local subspaces.</p>
<p>
It seems to me that this is one of the key things going on in the IUTT papers I-IV. As he say in loc. cit. he works with various categories of collections of local objects that <em>simulate</em> global objects. It is crucial in this process that many of the usual scheme-theoretic objects, local or global, are encoded as suitable categories with a rich and precise combinatorial structure. The details here get very complicated, the encoding of a scheme into an associated Galois category of finite 'etale covers being merely the trivial case. For example, when one would like to encode the Archimedean data coming from an arithmetic scheme (which again, will clearly be necessary for Szpiro’s conjecture), the attempt to come up with a category of about the same order of complexity as a Galois category gives rise to the notion of a <em>Frobenioid</em>. Since these play quite a central role in Mochizuki’s theory, I will quote briefly from his first Frobenioid paper:
</p>
<p>
‘Frobenioids provide a single framework [cf. the notion of a “Galois category”; the role of monoids in log geometry] that allows one to capture the essential aspects of both the Galois and the divisor theory of number fields, on the one hand, and function fields, on the other, in such a way that one may continue to work with, for instance, global degrees of arithmetic line bundles on a number field, but which also exhibits the new phenomenon [not present in the classical theory of number fields] of a “Frobenius endomorphism” of the Frobenioid associated to a number field.’
</p>
<p>
I believe the Frobenioid associated to a number field is something close to the finite 'etale covers of <span class="math inline">\(Spec(O_F)\)</span> (equipped with some log structure) together with metrized line bundles on them, although it’s probably more complicated. The Frobenious endomorphism for a prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is then something like the functor that just raises line bundles to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th power. This is a functor that would come from a map of schemes if we were working in characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, but obviously not in characteristic zero. But this is part of the reason to start encoding in categories:
</p>
<p><em>We get more morphisms and equivalences.</em></p>
<p>
Some of you will notice at this point the analogy to developments in algebraic geometry where varieties are encoded in categories, such as the derived category of coherent sheaves. There as well, one has reconstruction theorems of the Orlov type, as well as the phenomenon of non-geometric morphisms of the categories (say actions of braid groups). Non-geometric morphisms appear to be very important in Mochizuki’s theory, such as the Frobenius above, which allows us to simulate characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> geometry in characteristic zero. Another important illustrative example is a non-geometric isomorphism between Galois groups of local fields (which can’t exist for global fields because of the Neukirch-Uchida theorem). In fact, I think Mochizuki was rather fond of Ihara’s comment that the positive proof of the anabelian conjecture was somewhat of a disappointment, since it destroys the possibility that encoding curves into their fundamental groups will give rise to a richer category. Anyways, I believe the importance of non-geometric maps of categories encoding rather conventional objects is that
</p>
<p>
<em>they allow us to glue together several standard categories in nonstandard ways.</em>
</p>
<p>
Obviously, to play this game well, some things need to be encoded in rigid ways, while others should have more flexible encodings.
</p>
<p>
For a very simple example that gives just a bare glimpse of the general theory, you might consider a category of pairs <span class="math display">\[(G,F),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a profinite topological group of a certain type and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a filtration on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. It’s possible to write down explicit conditions that ensure that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is the Galois group of a local field and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is its ramification filtration in the upper numbering (actually, now I think about it, I’m not sure about ‘explicit conditions’ for the filtration part, but anyways). Furthermore, it is a theorem of Mochizuki and Abrashkin that the functor that takes a local field to the corresponding pair is fully faithful. So now, you can consider triples <span class="math display">\[(G,F_1, F_2),\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a group and the <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span> are <em>two</em> filtrations of the right type. If <span class="math inline">\(F_1=F_2\)</span>, then this ‘is’ just a local field. But now you can have objects with <span class="math inline">\(F_1\neq F_2\)</span>, that correspond to strange amalgams of two local fields.
</p>
<p>
As another example, one might take a usual global object, such as <span class="math display">\[ (E, O_F, E[l], V)\]</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> denotes a collection of valuations of <span class="math inline">\(F(E[l])\)</span> that restrict bijectively to the valuations <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>), and associate to it a collection of local categories indexed by <span class="math inline">\(V_0\)</span> (something like Frobenioids corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(E_v\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v\in V_0\)</span>). One can then try to glue them together in non-standard ways along sub-categories, after performing a number of non-standard transformations. My rough impression at the moment is that the ‘Hodge theatres’ arise in this fashion. [This is undoubtedly a gross oversimplification, which I will correct in later amendments.] You might further imagine that some construction of this sort will eventually retain the data necessary to get the height of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, but also have data corresponding to the <span class="math inline">\(G^{\mu}\)</span>, necessary for the Lagrangian KS map. In any case, I hope you can appreciate that a good deal of ‘dismantling’ and ‘reconstructing,’ what Mochizuki calls <em>surgery</em>, will be necessary.
</p>
<p>
I can’t emphasize enough times that much of what I write is based on faulty memory and guesswork. At best, it is superficial, while at worst, it is (not even) wrong. [<s>In particular, I am no longer sure that the GTKS map is used in an entirely direct fashion.</s>] I have not yet done anything with the current papers than give them a cursory glance. If I figure out more in the coming weeks, I will make corrections. But in the meanwhile, I do hope what I wrote here is mostly more helpful than misleading.
</p>
<p>
Allow me to make one remark about set theory, about which I know next to nothing. Even with more straightforward papers in arithmetic geometry, the question sometimes arises about Grothendieck’s universe axiom, mostly because universes appear to be used in SGA4. Usually, number-theorists (like me) neither understand, nor care about such foundational matters, and questions about them are normally met with a shrug. The conventional wisdom of course is that any of the usual theorems and proofs involving Grothendieck cohomology theories or topoi do not actually rely on the existence of universes, except general laziness allows us to insert some reference that eventually follows a trail back to SGA4. However, this doesn’t seem to be the case with Mochizuki’s paper. That is, universes and interactions between them seem to be important actors rather than conveniences. How this is really brought about, and whether more than the universe axiom is necessary for the arguments, I really don’t understand enough yet to say. In any case, for a number-theorist or an algebraic geometer, I would guess it’s still prudent to acquire a reasonable feel for the ‘usual’ background and motivation (that is, HAT, GTKS, and anabelian things) before worrying too much about deeper issues of set theory.

<h4>Answer 3 (score 85)</h4>
<p><em>Last revision: 10/20.</em> (Probably the last for at least some time to come: until Mochizuki uploads his revisions of IUTT-III and IUTT-IV. My apology for the multiple revisions. )</p>
<p><strong>Completely rewritten. (9/26)</strong></p>
<p>It seems indeed that nothing like Theorem 1.10 from Mochizuki’s IUTT-IV could hold.</p>
<p>Here is an infinite set of counterexamples, assuming for convenience two standard conjectures (the first being in fact a consequence of ABC), that contradict Thm. 1.10 <em>very</em> badly.</p>
<p><em>Assumptions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
A (Consequence of ABC) <em>For all but finitely many elliptic curves over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, the conductor <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and the minimal discriminant <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> satisfy <span class="math inline">\(\log{|\Delta|} &amp;lt; (\log{N})^2\)</span>.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
B (Uniform Serre Open Image conjecture) <em>For each</em> <span class="math inline">\(d \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, <em>there is a constant</em> <span class="math inline">\(c(d) &amp;lt; \infty\)</span> <em>such that for every number field</em> <span class="math inline">\(F/\mathbb{Q}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\([F:\mathbb{Q}] \leq d\)</span>, <em>and every non-CM elliptic curve</em> <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> <em>over</em> <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, <em>and every prime</em> <span class="math inline">\(\ell \geq c(d)\)</span>, <em>the Galois representation of</em> <span class="math inline">\(G_F\)</span> <em>on</em> <span class="math inline">\(E[\ell]\)</span> <em>has full image</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z}/{\ell})\)</span>. (In fact, it is sufficient to take the weaker version in which <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is held fixed. )
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Further, as far as I can tell from the proof of Theorem 1.10 of IUTTIV, the only reason for taking <span class="math inline">\(F := F_{\mathrm{tpd}}\big( \sqrt{-1}, E_{F_{\mathrm{tpd}}}[3\cdot 5]  \big)\)</span> — rather than simply <span class="math inline">\(F := F_{\mathrm{tpd}}(\sqrt{-1})\)</span> — was to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> has semistable reduction over <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>. <em>Since I will only work in what follows with semistable elliptic curves over</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, <em>I will assume, for a mild technical convenience in the examples below, that for elliptic curves already semistable over</em> <span class="math inline">\(F_{\mathrm{tpd}}\)</span>, <em>we may actually take</em> <span class="math inline">\(F := F_{\mathrm{tpd}}(\sqrt{-1})\)</span> <em>in Theorem 1.10.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>The infinite set of counterexamples.</em> They come from Masser’s paper [Masser: Note on a conjecture of Szpiro, <em>Asterisque</em> 1990], as follows. Masser has produced an infinite set of Frey-Hellougarch (i.e., semistable and with rational 2-torsion) elliptic curves over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> whose conductor <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and minimal discriminant <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> satisfy <span class="math display">\[
(1) \hspace{3cm} \frac{1}{6}\log{|\Delta|} \geq \log{N} + \frac{\sqrt{\log{N}}}{\log{\log{N}}}.
\]</span> (Thus, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> in these examples may be taken arbitrarily large. ) By (A) above, taking <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> big enough will ensure that <span class="math display">\[
(2) \hspace{3cm} \log{|\Delta|} &amp;lt; (\log{N})^2.
\]</span> Next, the sum of the logarithms of the primes in the interval <span class="math inline">\(\big( (\log{N})^2, 3(\log{N})^2 \big)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2(\log{N})^2 + o((\log{N})^2)\)</span>, so it is certainly <span class="math inline">\(&amp;gt; (\log{N})^2\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 0\)</span> big enough. Thus, by (2), it is easy to see that the interval <span class="math inline">\(\big( (\log{N})^2, 3(\log{N})^2 \big)\)</span> contains a prime <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> which divides neither <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta|\)</span> nor any of the exponents <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \mathrm{ord}_p(\Delta)\)</span> in the prime factorization <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta| = \prod p^{\alpha}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta|\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
Consider now the pair <span class="math inline">\((E,\ell)\)</span>: it has <span class="math inline">\(F_{\mathrm{mod}} = \mathbb{Q}\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> has rational <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-torsion, <span class="math inline">\(F_{\mathrm{tpd}} = \mathbb{Q}\)</span> as well. Let <span class="math inline">\(F := \mathbb{Q} \big( \sqrt{-1}\big)\)</span>. I claim that, upon taking <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> big enough, the pair <span class="math inline">\((E_F,\ell)\)</span> arises from an <strong>initial <span class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>-datum</strong> as in IUTT-I, Definition 3.1. Indeed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Certainly (a), (e), (f) of IUTT-I, Def. 3.1 are satisfied (with appropriate <span class="math inline">\(\\underline{\mathbb{V}}, \, \\underline{\epsilon}\)</span>);
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>of IUTT-I, Def. 3.1 is satisfied since by construction <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is semistable over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>;
</li>
<li>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>of IUTT-I, Def. 3.1 is satisfied, in view of (B) above and the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>, as soon as <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 0\)</span> is big enough (recall that <span class="math inline">\(\ell &amp;gt; (\log{N})^2\)</span> by construction!), and by the observation that, for <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> a place of <span class="math inline">\(F = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})\)</span>, the order of the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>-adic <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>-parameter of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ord}_v (\Delta)\)</span>, which equals <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{ord}_p(\Delta)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v \mid p &amp;gt; 2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2\cdot\mathrm{ord}_2(\Delta)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(v \mid 2\)</span>;
</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>while <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{V}_{\mathrm{mod}}^{\mathrm{bad}}\)</span> consists of the primes dividing <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>;</p>
<ul>
<li>
Finally, (d) of IUTT-I, Def. 3.1 is satisfied upon excluding at most four of Masser’s examples <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. (See page 37 of IUTT-IV).
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Now</strong>, take <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon := \big( \log{N} \big)^{-2}\)</span> in Theorem 1.10 of IUTT-IV; this is certainly permissible for <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 0\)</span> large enough. <em>I claim that the conclusion of Theorem 1.10 contradicts (1) as soon as <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 0\)</span> is large enough.</em></p>
<p>
For note that Mochizuki’s quantity <span class="math inline">\(\log(\mathfrak{q})\)</span> is precisely <span class="math inline">\(\log{|\Delta|}\)</span> (reference: see e.g. Szpiro’s article in the Grothendieck Festschrift, vol. 3); his <span class="math inline">\(\log{(\mathfrak{d}^{\mathrm{tpd}})}\)</span> is zero; his <span class="math inline">\(d_{\mathrm{mod}}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>; and his <span class="math inline">\(\log{(\mathfrak{f}^{\mathrm{tpd}})}\)</span> is our <span class="math inline">\(\log{N}\)</span>. By construction, our choice <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon := \big( \log{N} \big)^{-2}\)</span> then makes <span class="math inline">\(1/\ell &amp;lt; \epsilon\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\ell &amp;lt; 3/\epsilon\)</span>, whence the finaly display of Theorem 1.10 would yield <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{6} \log{|\Delta|} \leq (1+29\epsilon) \cdot \log{N} + 2\log{(3\epsilon^{-8})}
&amp;lt; \log{N} + 16\log{\log{N}} + 32,
\]</span> where we have used <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \log{N} = (\log{N})^{-1} &amp;lt; 1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(N &amp;gt; 3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(2\log{3} &amp;lt; 3\)</span>.
</p>
<p><em>The last display contradicts (1) as soon as <span class="math inline">\(N \gg 0\)</span> is big enough.</em></p>
<p>Thus Masser’s examples yield infinitely many counterexamples to Theorem 1.10 of IUTT-IV (as presently written).</p>
<p><strong>Added on 10/15, and revised 10/20.</strong> Mochizuki has commented on the apparent contradiction between Masser’s examples and Theorem 1.10:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/Inter-universal%20Teichmuller%20Theory%20IV%20(comments).pdf">http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/Inter-universal%20Teichmuller%20Theory%20IV%20(comments).pdf</a></p>
<p>He writes that he will revise portions of IUTT-III and IUTT-IV, and will make them available in the near future. (He estimates January 2013 to be a reasonable period). He confirms the following [“essentially”] anticipated revision of Theorem 1.10:</p>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline">\(E/\mathbb{Q}\)</span> be a semistable elliptic curve with [say, for the sake of simplifying] rational <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-torsion [i.e., a Frey-Hellegouarch curve] of minimal discriminant <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and conductor <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> (square-free). For <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &amp;gt; 0\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(N_{\epsilon} := \prod_{p \mid N, p &amp;lt; \epsilon^{-1}} p\)</span>. Then: <span class="math display">\[
\frac{1}{6} \log{|\Delta|} &amp;lt; \big( 1 + \epsilon \big) \log{N}  + \Big( \omega(N_{\epsilon}) \cdot \log{(1/\epsilon)} - \log{N_{\epsilon}} \Big)  + O\big( \log{(1/\epsilon)} \big) 
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
&amp;lt; \log{N} + \Big( \epsilon \log{N} + \big( \epsilon \log{(1/\epsilon)} \big)^{-1} \Big) + o\Big(  \big( \epsilon \log{(1/\epsilon)} \big)^{-1} \Big),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\omega(\cdot)\)</span> denotes “number of prime factors.” The second estimate comes from the prime number theorem in the form <span class="math inline">\(\pi(t) = t/\log{t} + t/(\log{t})^2 + o\big( t/(\log{t})^2 \big)\)</span>, applied to <span class="math inline">\(t := \epsilon^{-1}\)</span>, and is sharp if you restrict <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> to the range <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon^{-1} &amp;lt; (\log{N})^{\xi}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\xi &amp;lt; 1\)</span>, as there nothing prevents <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> from being divisible by all primes <span class="math inline">\(p &amp;lt; (\log{N})^{\xi}\)</span>. In particular, as the Erdos-Stewart-Tijdeman-Masser construction is based on the pigeonhole principle, which cannot preclude that <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> be divisible by all the primes <span class="math inline">\(&amp;lt; (\log{N})^{2/3}\)</span>, the second estimate could very well be sharp in all the Masser examples. As it is easily seen that the bracketed term exceeds the range <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{\log{N}}/(\log{\log{N}})\)</span> of Masser’s examples, this has the implication that
</p>
<p><em>the Erdos-Stewart-Tijdeman-Masser method cannot disprove Mochizuki’s revised inequality,</em></p>
<p>which therefore seems reasonable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we take <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon := (\log{N})^{-1}\)</span> <em>and</em> assume <span class="math inline">\(\omega(N_{\epsilon})\)</span> bounded, this would yield <span class="math inline">\((1/6)\log{|\Delta|} &amp;lt; \log{N} + O(\log{\log{N}})\)</span>, just as before. (<em>Thus, Mochizuki predicts that this last bound must hold for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> a large enough square-free integer such that the number of primes <span class="math inline">\(&amp;lt; \log{N}\)</span> dividing <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is bounded</em>. I cannot see evidence neither for nor against this at the moment: again, the Masser and Erdos-Stewart-Tijdeman constructions are based on the pigeonhole principle, and do not seem to be able to exclude the small primes <span class="math inline">\(&amp;lt; \log{N}\)</span>. So here we have an open problem by which one could probe Mochizuki’s revised inequality. A reminder: in terms of the <span class="math inline">\(abc\)</span>-triple, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is <em>essentially</em> <span class="math inline">\((abc)^2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N = \mathrm{rad}(abc)\)</span>).</p>
<p>A side remark: note that the inverse <span class="math inline">\(1/\ell\)</span> of the prime level from the de Rham-Etale correspondence <span class="math inline">\((E^{\dagger}, &amp;lt; \ell) \leftrightarrow E[\ell]\)</span> in Mochizuki’s “Hodge-Arakelov theory” ultimately figures as the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> in the ABC conjecture.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>It can be difficult to learn mathematics on your own from textbooks, and I often wish universities videotaped their mathematics courses and distributed them for free online. Fortunately, some universities do that (albeit to a very limited extent), and I hope we can compile here a list of all the mathematics courses one can view in their entirety online.</p>
<p>Please only post videos of entire courses; that is, a speaker giving one lecture introducing a subject to the audience should be off-limits, but a sequence of, say, 30 hour-long videos, each of which is a lecture delivered in a class would be very much on-topic.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 180)</h4>
<p>I think Algebraic Geometry is too broad a subject to choose only one book. Maybe if one is a beginner then a clear introductory book is enough or if algebraic geometry is not ones major field of study then a self-contained reference dealing with the important topics thoroughly is enough. But Algebraic Geometry nowadays has grown into such a deep and ample field of study that a graduate student has to focus heavily on one or two topics whereas at the same time must be able to use the fundamental results of other close subfields. Therefore I find the attempt to reduce his/her study to just one book (besides Hartshorne’s) too hard and unpractical. That is why I have collected what in my humble opinion are the best books for each stage and topic of study, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/richpub/listmania/fullview/RHQS8Y3V7LJRQ/ref=cm_sw_su_l" rel="noreferrer">my personal choices for the best books are then:</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
CLASSICAL: <strong>Beltrametti-Carletti-Gallarati-Monti.</strong> <em>“Lectures on Curves, Surfaces and Projective Varieties”</em> which starts from the very beginning with a classical geometric style. Very complete (proves Riemann-Roch for curves in an easy language) and concrete in classic constructions needed to understand the reasons about why things are done the way they are in advanced purely algebraic books. There are very few books like this and they should be a must to start learning the subject. (Check out <a href="http://www.dima.unige.it/~beltrame/Math.Rev.pdf" rel="noreferrer">Dolgachev’s review</a>.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
HALF-WAY/UNDERGRADUATE: <strong>Shafarevich</strong> - <em>“Basic Algebraic Geometry”</em> vol. 1 and 2. They may be the most complete on foundations for varieties up to introducing schemes and complex geometry, so they are very useful before more abstract studies. But the problems are hard for many beginners. They do not prove Riemann-Roch (which is done classically without cohomology in the previous recommendation) so a modern more orthodox course would be Perrin’s “Algebraic Geometry, An Introduction”, which in fact introduce cohomology and prove RR.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ADVANCED UNDERGRADUATE: <strong>Holme</strong> - <em>“A Royal Road to Algebraic Geometry”</em>. This new title is wonderful: it starts by introducing algebraic affine and projective curves and varieties and builds the theory up in the first half of the book as the perfect introduction to Hartshorne’s chapter I. The second half then jumps into a categorical introduction to schemes, bits of cohomology and even glimpses of intersection theory.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ONLINE NOTES: <strong>Gathmann</strong> - <em>“Algebraic Geometry”</em> which can be found <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/agag/mitglieder/professoren/gathmann/notes/alggeom/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Just amazing notes; short but very complete, dealing even with schemes and cohomology and proving Riemann-Roch and even hinting Hirzebruch-R-R. It is the best free course in my opinion, to get enough algebraic geometry background to understand the other more advanced and abstract titles. For an abstract algebraic approach, a freely available online course is available by the nicely done <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/" rel="noreferrer">new long notes by R. <strong>Vakil</strong></a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GRADUATE FOR ALGEBRISTS AND NUMBER THEORISTS: <strong>Liu Qing</strong> - <em>“Algebraic Geometry and Arithmetic Curves”</em>. It is a very complete book even introducing some needed commutative algebra and preparing the reader to learn arithmetic geometry like Mordell’s conjecture, Faltings’ or even Fermat-Wiles Theorem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GRADUATE FOR GEOMETERS: <strong>Griffiths; Harris</strong> - <em>“Principles of Algebraic Geometry”</em>. By far the best for a complex-geometry-oriented mind. Also useful coming from studies on several complex variables or differential geometry. It develops a lot of algebraic geometry without so much advanced commutative and homological algebra as the modern books tend to emphasize.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
BEST ON SCHEMES: <strong>Görtz; Wedhorn</strong> - <em>Algebraic Geometry I, Schemes with Examples and Exercises</em>. Tons of stuff on schemes; more complete than Mumford’s Red Book (For an online free alternative check Mumfords’ Algebraic Geometry II <a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/~chai/624_08/math624_08.html" rel="noreferrer">unpublished notes</a> on schemes.). It does a great job complementing Hartshorne’s treatment of schemes, above all because of the more solvable exercises.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
UNDERGRADUATE ON ALGEBRAIC CURVES: <strong>Fulton</strong> - <em>“Algebraic Curves, an Introduction to Algebraic Geometry”</em> which can be found <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~wfulton/CurveBook.pdf" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. It is a classic and although the flavor is clearly of typed concise notes, it is by far the shortest but thorough book on curves, which serves as a very nice introduction to the whole subject. It does everything that is needed to prove Riemann-Roch for curves and introduces many concepts useful to motivate more advanced courses.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
GRADUATE ON ALGEBRAIC CURVES: <strong>Arbarello; Cornalba; Griffiths; Harris</strong> - <em>“Geometry of Algebraic Curves”</em> vol 1 and 2. This one is focused on the reader, therefore many results are stated to be worked out. So some people find it the best way to really master the subject. Besides, the vol. 2 has finally appeared making the two huge volumes a complete reference on the subject.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
INTRODUCTORY ON ALGEBRAIC SURFACES: <strong>Beauville</strong> - <em>“Complex Algebraic Surfaces”</em>. I have not found a quicker and simpler way to learn and clasify algebraic surfaces. The background needed is minimum compared to other titles.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ADVANCED ON ALGEBRAIC SURFACES: <strong>Badescu</strong> - <em>“Algebraic Surfaces”</em>. Excellent complete and advanced reference for surfaces. Very well done and indispensable for those needing a companion, but above all an expansion, to Hartshorne’s chapter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ON HODGE THEORY AND TOPOLOGY: <strong>Voisin</strong> - <em>Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry</em> vols. I and II. The first volume can serve almost as an introduction to complex geometry and the second to its topology. They are becoming more and more the standard reference on these topics, fitting nicely between abstract algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
INTRODUCTORY ON MODULI AND INVARIANTS: <strong>Mukai</strong> - <em>An Introduction to Invariants and Moduli</em>. Excellent but extremely expensive hardcover book. When a cheaper paperback edition is released by Cambridge Press any serious student of algebraic geometry should own a copy since, again, it is one of those titles that help motivate and give conceptual insights needed to make any sense of abstract monographs like the next ones.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ON MODULI SPACES AND DEFORMATIONS: <strong>Hartshorne</strong> - <em>“Deformation Theory”</em>. Just the perfect complement to Hartshorne’s main book, since it did not deal with these matters, and other books approach the subject from a different point of view (e.g. geared to complex geometry or to physicists) than what a student of AG from Hartshorne’s book may like to learn the subject.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ON GEOMETRIC INVARIANT THEORY: <strong>Mumford; Fogarty; Kirwan</strong> - <em>“Geometric Invariant Theory”</em>. Simply put, it is still the best and most complete. Besides, Mumford himself developed the subject. Alternatives are more introductory lectures by Dolgachev.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ON INTERSECTION THEORY: <strong>Fulton</strong> - <em>“Intersection Theory”</em>. It is the standard reference and is also cheap compared to others. It deals with all the material needed on intersections for a serious student going beyond Hartshorne’s appendix; it is a good reference for the use of the language of characteristic classes in algebraic geometry, proving Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch and Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch among many interesting results.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ON SINGULARITIES: <strong>Kollár</strong> - <em>Lectures on Resolution of Singularities</em>. Great exposition, useful contents and examples on topics one has to deal with sooner or later. As a fundamental complement check <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2003-40-03/S0273-0979-03-00982-0/home.html" rel="noreferrer">Hauser’s wonderful paper</a> on the Hironaka theorem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ON POSITIVITY: <strong>Lazarsfeld</strong> - <em>Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I: Classical Setting: Line Bundles and Linear Series</em> and <em>Positivity in Algebraic Geometry II: Positivity for Vector Bundles and Multiplier Ideals</em>. Amazingly well written and unique on the topic, summarizing and bringing together lots of information, results, and many many examples.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
INTRODUCTORY ON HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL VARIETIES: <strong>Debarre</strong> - <em>“Higher Dimensional Algebraic Geometry”</em>. The main alternative to this title is the new book by <strong>Hacon/Kovács</strong>’ “<em>Classifiaction of Higher-dimensional Algebraic Varieties</em>” which includes recent results on the classification problem and is intended as a graduate topics course.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
ADVANCED ON HIGHER-DIMENSIONAL VARIETIES: <strong>Kollár; Mori</strong> - <em>Birational Geometry of Algebraic Varieties</em>. Considered as harder to learn from by some students, it has become the standard reference on birational geometry.

<p>Perhaps this is cliché, but I recommend EGA (links to full texts: <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1960__4__5_0">I</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1961__8__5_0">II</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1961__11__5_0">III(1)</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1963__17__5_0">III(2)</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1964__20__5_0">IV(1)</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1965__24__5_0">IV(2)</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1966__28__5_0">IV(3)</a>, <a href="http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/item?id=PMIHES_1967__32__5_0">IV(4)</a>).</p>
<p>I know it’s a scary 1800 pages of French, but</p>
<ol>
<li>
It’s really easy French. I would describe myself as not knowing any French, but I can read EGA without too much trouble.
</li>
<li>
It’s extremely clear. The proofs are usually very short because the results are very well organized.
</li>
<li>
It’s the canonical reference for algebraic geometry. I assure you it is not 1800 pages of fluff.
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve found it quite rewarding to to familiarize myself with the contents of EGA. Many algebraic geometry students are able to say with confidence “that’s one of the exercises in Hartshorne, chapter II, section 4.” It’s even more empowering to have that kind of command over a text like EGA, which covers much more material with fewer unnecessary hypotheses and with greater clarity. I’ve found <a href="http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~tp/french.canon/">this combined table of contents</a> to be useful in this quest.

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Imagine the beginning of a game of pool, you have 16 balls, 15 of them in a triangle &lt;| and 1 of them being the cue ball off to the left of that triangle. Imagine that the rack (the 15 balls in a triangle) has every ball equally spaced apart and all balls touching all other appropriate balls. All balls are perfectly round. Now, imagine that the cue ball was hit along a friction free surface on the center axis for this triangle O——-&lt;| and hits the far left ball of the rack dead center on this axis. How would the rack react? I would imagine this would be an extension of newtons cradle and only the 5 balls on the far end would move at all. But in what way would they move? Thanks</p>

<p>This question was <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/658871/perfectly-centered-break-of-a-perfectly-aligned-pool-ball-rack">cross-posted</a> on Math Stack Exchange. Here is a copy of <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/658871/perfectly-centered-break-of-a-perfectly-aligned-pool-ball-rack/659318#659318">my answer for it there</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is it.  The perfectly centered billiards break.  Behold.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y9ixR.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<h5>
Setup
</h2>
<p>This break was computed in <em>Mathematica</em> using a numerical differential equations model. Here are a few details of the model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
All balls are assumed to be perfectly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_%28physics%29" rel="noreferrer">elastic</a> and almost perfectly rigid.
</li>
<li>
Each ball has a mass of 1 unit and a radius of 1 unit.
</li>
<li>
The cue ball has a initial speed of 10 units/sec.
</li>
<li>
The force between two balls is given by the formula <span class="math display">\[
F \;=\; \begin{cases}0 &amp;amp; \text{if }d \geq 2, \\ 10^{11}(2-d)^{3/2} &amp;amp; \text{if }d&amp;lt;2,\end{cases}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is the distance between the centers of the balls. Note that the balls overlap if and only if <span class="math inline">\(d &amp;lt; 2\)</span>. The power of <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> was <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/156263/perfectly-centered-break-of-a-perfectly-aligned-pool-ball-rack/156407?noredirect=1#comment400402_156407">suggested by Yoav Kallus</a> in the comments, because it follows <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_mechanics#Hertzian_theory_of_non-adhesive_elastic_contact" rel="noreferrer">Hertz’s theory of non-adhesive elastic contact</a>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial speed of the cue ball is immaterial – slowing down the cue ball is the same as slowing down time. The force constant <span class="math inline">\(10^{11}\)</span> has no real effect as long as it’s large enough, although it does change the speed at which the initial collision takes place.</p>
<h5>
The Collision
</h2>
<p>For this model, the entire collision takes place in the first 0.2 milliseconds, and none of the balls overlap by more than 0.025% of their radius during the collision. (These figures are model dependent – real billiard balls may collide faster or slower than this.)</p>
<p>The following animation shows the forces between the balls during the collision, with the force proportional to the area of each yellow circle. Note that the balls themselves hardly move at all <em>during</em> the collision, although they do accelerate quite a bit.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WY37i.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<h5>
The Trajectories
</h2>
<p>The following picture shows the trajectories of the billiard balls after the collision.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wHVJA.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>After the collision, some of the balls are travelling considerably faster than others. The following table shows the magnitude and direction of the velocity of each ball, where <span class="math inline">\(0^\circ\)</span> indicates straight up.</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\text{ball} &amp;amp; \text{cue} &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 2,3 &amp;amp; 4,6 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;amp; 7,10 &amp;amp; 8,9 &amp;amp; 11,15 &amp;amp; 12,14 &amp;amp; 13 \\
\hline
\text{angle} &amp;amp; 0^\circ &amp;amp; 0^\circ &amp;amp; 40.1^\circ &amp;amp; 43.9^\circ &amp;amp; 0^\circ &amp;amp; 82.1^\circ &amp;amp; 161.8^\circ &amp;amp; 150^\circ &amp;amp; 178.2^\circ &amp;amp; 180^\circ \\
\hline
\text{speed} &amp;amp; 1.79 &amp;amp; 1.20 &amp;amp; 1.57 &amp;amp; 1.42 &amp;amp; 0.12 &amp;amp; 1.31 &amp;amp; 0.25 &amp;amp; 5.60 &amp;amp; 2.57 &amp;amp; 2.63 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]</span>
</p>
<p>For comparison, remember that the initial speed of the cue ball was 10 units/sec. Thus, balls 11 and 15 (the back corner balls) shoot out at more than half the speed of the original cue ball, whereas ball 5 slowly rolls upwards at less than 2% of the speed of the original cue ball.</p>
<p>By the way, if you add up the sum of the squares of the speeds of the balls, you get 100, since kinetic energy is conserved.</p>
<h5>
Linear and Quadratic Responses
</h2>
<p>The results of this model are dependent on the power of <span class="math inline">\(3/2\)</span> in the force law – other force laws give other breaks. For example, we could try making the force a linear function of the overlap distance (in analogy with springs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law" rel="noreferrer">Hooke’s law</a>), or we could try making the force proportional to the <em>square</em> of the overlap distance. The results are noticeably different</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/a1l3b.gif" alt="enter image description here"> <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xM76n.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<h5>
Stiff Response
</h2>
<p>Glenn the Udderboat points out that “stiff” balls might be best approximated by a force response involving a higher power of the distance (although this isn’t the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiffness" rel="noreferrer">usual definition</a> of “stiffness”). Unfortunately, the calculation time in <em>Mathematica</em> becomes longer when the power is increased, presumably because it needs to use a smaller time step to be sufficiently accurate.</p>
<p>
Here is a simulation involving a reasonably “stiff” force law <span class="math display">\[
F \;=\; \begin{cases}0 &amp;amp; \text{if }d \geq 2, \\ 10^{54}(2-d)^{10} &amp;amp; \text{if }d&amp;lt;2.\end{cases}
\]</span>
</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/nMJyT.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>As you can see, the result is very similar to <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/658871/perfectly-centered-break-of-a-perfectly-aligned-pool-ball-rack/658894#658894">my initial answer</a> on Math Stack Exchange. This seems like good evidence that the behavior discussed in my initial answer is indeed the limiting behavior in the case where this notion of “stiffness” goes to infinity.</p>
<p>As you might expect, most of the energy in this case is transferred very quickly at the beginning of the collision. Almost all of the energy has moves to the back corner balls in the first 0.02 milliseconds. Here is an animation of the forces:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VuUWT.gif" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p>After that, the corner balls and the cue ball shoot out, and the remaining balls continue to collide gently for the next millisecond or so.</p>
<p>While the simplicity of this behavior is appealing, I would guess that “real” billard balls do not have such a force response. Of the models listed here, the intial Hertz-based model is probably the most accurate. Qualitatively, it certainly seems the closest to an “actual” break.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have now posted the <em>Mathematica</em> code on my <a href="http://faculty.bard.edu/belk/code.htm" rel="noreferrer">web page</a>.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 18)</h4>
<p>This is more of a comment inspired by Jim Belk’s answer than an answer to the question in itself. It is also more physics than mathematics. However, I hope I can help readers see that this system is related to some very interesting science.</p>
<p>I wanted to say a little bit about the dynamics of the energy transfer in the billiard break. Very naïvely, you might think of a triangular lattice of interacting particles (the billiard rack) as acting like a discrete model for a crystalline solid. Solids support sound waves (just knock on your table and listen), and so again naïvely we might expect that the billiard break occurs via some strong compressional sound waves propagating through the system, akin to those vibrations induced when knocking on wood. However, this naïve intuition is wrong!</p>
<p>A system of billiards all just barely touching, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cradle" rel="noreferrer">Newton’s cradle</a>, is an example of a <em>sonic vacuum</em> (<a href="http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/abs/2012/06/epn2012436p36/epn2012436p36.html" rel="noreferrer">see e.g. this expository physics article</a>).</p>
<p>The term was coined by Vitali Nesterenko to describe mechanical systems where the speed of sound vanishes and the tiniest perturbation must lead to supersonic shocks – behavior very far from that of ordinary sound. The usual formula for the speed of sound in say a chain of identical masses joined by identical springs is <span class="math inline">\(v_s=\sqrt{k/m}a\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the spring constant, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the mass, and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the length of the springs. In a system interacting via a nonlinear force law like Hertz’s, the effective spring constant is <span class="math inline">\(df/d\delta|_{\delta=0}=0\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> is the overlap between particles) which actually vanishes! Thus the speed of sound is zero. This is a very special situation which occurs because the particles are all just barely touching.</p>
<p>The consequence of all this is that energy cannot propagate via ordinary sound, and what appears instead is a shock wave, satisfying a <em>nonlinear</em> PDE. In Jim Belk’s pictures, this is what we see as the “shock front” colored yellow traveling from the point of impact through the billiards.</p>
<p>Nesterenko wrote down a continuum limit for systems of Hertzian particles (the following is specialized to particles arranged on a triangular lattice):</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial^2\xi}{\partial t^2}=c^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}\left[\xi^{3/2}+\frac{2R^2}{5}\xi^{1/4}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}(\xi^{5/4})\right]\)</span></p>
<p>(If one wants to study shock waves in systems of particles interacting with other force laws, then some of the exponents here change). Also, none of the above discussion really depends on the “perfectly centered” initial condition. I think the paper I cite below may give you some idea of what can happen as we vary the initial angle.</p>
<blockquote>
It might be interesting to compare the solutions of this equation with suitable boundary conditions to simulations along the line of Jim Belk’s for a very large pool ball rack (large enough at least so that one can follow the shock wave for an appreciable length of time).
</blockquote>
<p>
The derivation of the above equation is apparently in Nesterenko’s book “Dynamics of Heterogeneous Materials”, though I learned it from this very relevant paper coauthored by some friends of mine: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5890" rel="noreferrer">Transmission and reflection of strongly nonlinear solitary waves at granular interfaces, by A. M. Tichler, L. R. Gomez, N. Upadhyaya, X. Campman, V. F. Nesterenko, V. Vitelli</a>. In this paper they study the propagation of shocks through interfaces between packings of billiard balls of two different masses. I think you’ll agree it’s quite close to the billiard break.

<p>In forming your answer you may treat the qualifier <em>math</em> or <em>maths</em> as optional, since part of the question is whether there is anything peculiar to the subject of mathematics that demands anything peculiar of the teacher.‡</p>
<p>The question is hardly new, but it came up most recently in the context of <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/5353/how-to-respond-to-i-was-never-much-good-at-maths-at-school/5354#5354">answering another question</a> about good ways to respond to people who say,“I was never much good at maths at school”, especially if one is motivated to give “answers that would actually educate the other person”.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 17)</h4>
<p>I have answered this question with what I hope are some qualities a teacher can learn in order to improve their class. This is as opposed to listing qualities of a truly exceptional math teacher. I wrote this thinking of middle and high school level math, but most of it could be applied at other levels as well.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A good math teacher should motivate the math and engage the students. Take the example of solving linear equation. One can start by telling students the formal rules for how to manipulate an equation, but I think students will find this very dry, and won’t understand why they are doing what they are doing. It becomes and exercise in memorization. Instead, one can start with problems that can be solved with such equation. One can first get students to solve them with other techniques (e.g. guessing and checking or using some sort of graph). After a while one realizes there should be an easier way, which turns out to be solving a linear equation. This way the students understand why the formal math was developed, understand how to apply it, and see how it is related with other ideas (like graphs). Right now you might ask where one can find good problems to use in this way. I think I will ask that as a separate question…</p></li>
<li><p>A good math teacher makes their students do math. I think it is crucial that every student, in every math class, every day, solve some math problems. Some of these should be easy (i.e. just practice solving equations, once they have been introduced), and some should require more creativity. It is of course a mistake to drill students with boring problems until they hate the subject, but it is also a mistake to let them do “interesting” or “discovery based” math all the time, and not make them practice the techniques they discover.</p></li>
<li><p>A good math teacher should convey the beauty of the subject. One of the other answers said ``infectious enthusiasm&quot; was needed. That would be great, but in reality not all math teachers can be that charismatic. Even without a great deal of charisma, I believe it is possible to show students the wonder of extracting a simple answer from a seemingly difficult question, and the beauty of the tools that help one do this. Often it is enough that students see that their teacher believes this. So in particular, I do not think it is a good idea to say things like “I hated math when I was your age too, but we’ll get through this”.</p></li>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 11)</h4>
<p>Every great teacher has his or her own teaching style and philosophy but here are some thoughts on things that I think make for a pretty good teacher (some more math-specific and some less so).</p>
<p>I think good teachers respect their students. I think teachers can effectively engage students by treating teaching and learning as a collaborative process and by showing their students that their thoughts and opinions are valued. It can be really good motivation for students to feel that they’re working <em>with</em> their teacher to develop their understanding.</p>
<p>Following on from that, I think good teachers can get their students talking. Having students ask and answer questions about the material being covered is a great way to get them really thinking about the ideas for themselves. Also, some teachers really encourage their students to talk to each other and I think that’s a great way to show students how much they can learn from each other, independent of their teacher.</p>
<p>Along those lines, great teachers should challenge their students. They should encourage their students to get out of the mindset of “I only know as much as my teacher tells me”. In math, I feel like many students end up expecting all the problems they encounter to be similar to some example they’ve been shown. An invaluable skill that great teachers pass on to their students is the ability to take their knowledge and skills and apply them in unfamiliar situations. It’s important to show students that they can do things on their own!</p>
<p>Great teachers provide positive encouragement and credit where it’s due. When you’re in the middle of learning something, it can be hard to take stock of how far you’ve come or whether you actually know more than you did weeks or months ago. So it’s important for teachers to keep track of their students’ progress and to let them know about it.</p>
<p>Especially in math, I think good teachers provide motivation and explanation for the material. It’s so easy to get caught up in formulas and theorems and simply ignore where they came from but it’s so important to make sure that students realise that math doesn’t just come out of nowhere. Even in cases where rigorous explanations are a little beyond the students, good teachers can appeal to their students’ intuition and give basic ideas about why things are true. Being able to show students that math is all about logic and reasoning and that it should make sense I think is the mark of a really incredible teacher.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 7)</h4>
<p>Initially, this was supposed to be a comment about point 3) in Peter Tingley’s answer, about a math teacher being able to “convey the beauty of the subject”, but it got too long so I turned it into an answer.</p>
<p>While I generally agree with it, I think it is also a tad too idealistic. Dr. Johnson, in one of his invectives against the Scots, barked that “much may be made of a Scot if he be caught young”. Contrapositively, if a student arrives at university without any appreciation for Mathematics, there is only the slimmest of chances that he will gain it there. And teenagers? Mathematics has to compete in a teenager’s mind with Lady Gaga and porn sites; with mtv rap and online gaming; with entertainments that range from the irrational to the inane. Call me an elitist cynic, but the plain matter of fact is that the majority of students will be completely unmoved by the beauty of mathematics, much as great literature can only be understood and enjoyed by a relative minority within each generation. I guess what I am saying is that a quality that a good teacher must have is a thick-skin and somehow, by whatever means, keep the flame alive inside his own heart so that when that special, receptive student does come along, he will be able to kindle the fire and infect him with the rapturous love for Mathematics. Or in the words of Samuel Beckett, “Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.”</p>

<h3>13: What’s a mathematician to do? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/43690.html">96030</a> in 2010)</h3>
<section id="question-12" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I have to apologize because this is not the normal sort of question for this site, but there have been times in the past where MO was remarkably helpful and kind to undergrads with similar types of question and since it is worrying me increasingly as of late I feel that I must ask it.</p>
<p>My question is: what can one (such as myself) contribute to mathematics?</p>
<p>I find that mathematics is made by people like Gauss and Euler - while it may be possible to learn their work and understand it, nothing new is created by doing this. One can rewrite their books in modern language and notation or guide others to learn it too but I never believed this was the significant part of a mathematician work; which would be the creation of original mathematics. It seems entirely plausible that, with all the tremendously clever people working so hard on mathematics, there is nothing left for someone such as myself (who would be the first to admit they do not have any special talent in the field) to do. Perhaps my value would be to act more like cannon fodder? Since just sending in <em>enough</em> men in will surely break through some barrier.</p>
<p>Anyway I don’t want to ramble too much but I really would like to find answers to this question - whether they come from experiences or peoples biographies or anywhere.</p>

<p>It’s not <em>mathematics</em> that you need to contribute to. It’s deeper than that: how might you contribute to humanity, and even deeper, to the well-being of the world, by pursuing mathematics? Such a question is not possible to answer in a purely intellectual way, because the effects of our actions go far beyond our understanding. We are deeply social and deeply instinctual animals, so much that our well-being depends on many things we do that are hard to explain in an intellectual way. That is why you do well to follow your heart and your passion. Bare reason is likely to lead you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski">astray</a>. None of us are smart and wise enough to figure it out intellectually.</p>
<p>The product of mathematics is clarity and understanding. Not theorems, by themselves. Is there, for example any real reason that even such famous results as Fermat’s Last Theorem, or the Poincaré conjecture, really matter? Their real importance is not in their specific statements, but their role in challenging our understanding, presenting challenges that led to mathematical developments that increased our understanding.</p>
<p>The world does not suffer from an oversupply of clarity and understanding (to put it mildly). How and whether specific mathematics might lead to improving the world (whatever that means) is usually impossible to tease out, but mathematics collectively is extremely important.</p>
<p>I think of mathematics as having a large component of psychology, because of its strong dependence on human minds. Dehumanized mathematics would be more like computer code, which is very different. Mathematical ideas, even simple ideas, are often hard to transplant from mind to mind. There are many ideas in mathematics that may be hard to get, but are easy once you get them. Because of this, mathematical understanding does not expand in a monotone direction. Our understanding frequently deteriorates as well. There are several obvious mechanisms of decay. The experts in a subject retire and die, or simply move on to other subjects and forget. Mathematics is commonly explained and recorded in symbolic and concrete forms that are easy to communicate, rather than in conceptual forms that are easy to understand once communicated. Translation in the direction conceptual -&gt; concrete and symbolic is much easier than translation in the reverse direction, and symbolic forms often replaces the conceptual forms of understanding. And mathematical conventions and taken-for-granted knowledge change, so older texts may become hard to understand.</p>
<p>In short, mathematics only exists in a living community of mathematicians that spreads understanding and breaths life into ideas both old and new. The real satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from others and sharing with others. All of us have clear understanding of a few things and murky concepts of many more. There is no way to run out of ideas in need of clarification. The question of who is the first person to ever set foot on some square meter of land is really secondary. Revolutionary change does matter, but revolutions are few, and they are not self-sustaining — they depend very heavily on the community of mathematicians.</p>

<h3>15: Examples of unexpected mathematical images (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/178139.html">95027</a> in 2014)</h3>
<section id="question-14" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I try to generate a lot of examples in my research to get a better feel for what I am doing. Sometimes, I generate a plot, or a figure, that really surprises me, and makes my research take an unexpected turn, or let me have a moment of enlightenment.</p>
<p>For example, a hidden symmetry is revealed or a connection to another field becomes apparent.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Give an example of a picture from your research, description on how it was generated, and what insight it gave.</em></p>
<p>
I am especially interested in what techniques people use to make images, this is something that I find a bit lacking in most research articles. From answers to this question; hope to learn some “standard” tricks/transformations one can do on data, to reveal hidden structure.
</p>
<p>
<em>As an example, a couple of years ago, I studied asymptotics of (generalized) eigenvalues of non-square Toeplitz matrices. The following two pictures revealed a hidden connection to orthogonal polynomials in several variables, and a connection to Schur polynomials and representation theory. Without these hints, I have no idea what would have happened. Explanation: The deltoid picture is a 2-dimensional subspace of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> where certain generalized eigenvalues for a simple, but large Toeplitz matrix appeared, so this is essentially solutions to a highly degenerate system of polynomial equations. Using a certain map, these roots could be lifted to the hexagonal region, revealing a very structured pattern. This gave insight in how the limit density of the roots is. This is essentially roots of a 2d-analogue of Chebyshev polynomials, but I did not know that at the time. The subspace in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}^2\)</span> where the deltoid lives is quite special, and we could not explain this. A subsequent paper by a different author answered this question, which lead to an analogue of being Hermitian for rectangular Toeplitz matrices.</em>

</p>
<p>Perhaps you do not have a single picture; then you might want to illustrate a transformation that you test on data you generate. For example, every polynomial defines a coamoeba, by mapping roots <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\arg z_i\)</span>. This transformation sometimes reveal interesting structure, and it partially did in the example above.</p>
<p>If you don’t generate pictures in your research, you can still participate in the discussion, by submitting a (historical) picture you think had a similar impact (with motivation). Examples I think that can appear here might be <em>the first picture of the Mandelbrot set</em>, <em>the first bifurcation diagram</em>, or perhaps <em><a href="http://www.math.ucr.edu/home/baez/roots/">roots of polynomials with integer coefficients</a></em>.</p>

<p>The third image below was certainly unexpected for my soon-to-be-collaborators, Emmanuel Candes and Justin Romberg. They started with a standard image in signal processing, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepp%E2%80%93Logan_phantom">Logan-Shepp phantom</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xIuK9.jpg" alt="Original image"></p>
<p>They took a sparse set of Fourier measurements of this image along 22 radial lines (simulating a crude MRI scan). Conventional wisdom was that this was a very lossy set of measurements, losing most of the original data. Indeed, if one tried to use the standard least squares method to reconstruct the image from this data, one got terrible results:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PcGCA.jpg" alt="least squares reconstruction"></p>
<p>However, Emmanuel and Justin were experimenting with a different method, in which one minimised the total variation norm rather than the least squares norm subject to the given measurements, and were hoping to get a somewhat better reconstruction. What they actually got was this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NsSWs.jpg" alt="TV reconstruction"></p>
<p>Unbelievably, using only about 2% of the available Fourier coefficients, they had managed to reconstruct the original Logan-Shepp phantom so perfectly that the differences were invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>When Emmanuel told me this result, I couldn’t believe it either, and tried to write down a theoretical proof that such perfect reconstruction was impossible from so little data. Much to my surprise, I found instead that random matrix theory could be used to guarantee exact reconstruction from a remarkably small number of measurements. We then worked together to optimise and streamline the results; this led to some of the pioneering work in the area now known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing">compressed sensing</a>.</p>

<p>It feels like there should be a nice symmetry-based argument for this answer, but I can’t figure it out. I remember seeing once a solution to this problem where the two endpoints of the interval were joined to form a circle, but I can’t reconstruct it. Can anybody help?</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 97)</h4>
<p>Here’s what seems like the sort of argument you’re looking for (based off of a trick Wendel used to compute the probability the convex hull of a set of random points on a sphere contains the center of the sphere, which is really the same question in disguise):</p>
<p>Connect the endpoints of the stick into a circle. We now imagine we’re cutting at three points instead of two. We can form a triangle if none of the resulting pieces is at least 1/2, i.e. if no semicircle contains all three of our cut points.</p>
<p>Now imagine our cut as being formed in two stages. In the first stage, we choose three pairs of antipodal points on the circle. In the second, we choose one point from each pair to cut at. The sets of three points lying in a semicircle (the nontriangles) correspond exactly to the sets of three consecutive points out of our six chosen points. This means that 6 out of the possible 8 selections in the second stage lead to a non-triangle, regardless of the pairs of points chosen in the first stage.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 56)</h4>
<p>Consider an equilateral triangle with altitude 1. It is not hard to show that if you choose a point randomly in this triangle, the distances to the three sides gives the same distribution of lengths that you obtain by breaking a stick at two random points. Now, the locus of points for which no distance is longer than 1/2 is the smaller equilateral triangle formed by joining the midpoints of the edges, which has area 1/4 that of the original triangle.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 28)</h4>
<p>
A triangle is possible iff no part is <span class="math inline">\(&amp;gt;{1\over2}\)</span>. With probability <span class="math inline">\({1\over2}\)</span> both cuts are on the same side of the midpoint <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, in which case no triangle is possible. If the cuts <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\ x &amp;lt; y\)</span>, are on different sides of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> then with probability <span class="math inline">\({1\over 2}\)</span> the point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is further left in its half than <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is in the right half. In this case there is no triangle possible either. It follows that only <span class="math inline">\({1\over 4}\)</span> of all cuts admit the forming of a triangle.

<h3>17: Google question: In a country in which people only want boys (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/17960.html">91404</a> in )</h3>
<section id="question-16" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Google published recently questions that are asked to candidates on interviews. One of them caused very very hot debates in our company and we’re unsure where the truth is. The question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In a country in which people only want boys every family continues to have children until they have a boy. If they have a girl, they have another child. If they have a boy, they stop. What is the proportion of boys to girls in the country?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite that the official answer is 50/50 I feel that something wrong with it. Starting to solve the problem for myself I got that part of girls can be calculated with following series:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^n}\left (1-\frac{1}{n+1}\right )\]</span></p>
<p>This leads to an answer: there will be ~61% of girls.</p>
<p>The official solution is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This one caused quite the debate, but we figured it out following these steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Imagine you have 10 couples who have 10 babies. 5 will be girls. 5 will be boys. (Total babies made: 10, with 5 boys and 5 girls)
</li>
<li>
The 5 couples who had girls will have 5 babies. Half (2.5) will be girls. Half (2.5) will be boys. Add 2.5 boys to the 5 already born and 2.5 girls to the 5 already born. (Total babies made: 15, with 7.5 boys and 7.5 girls.)
</li>
<li>
The 2.5 couples that had girls will have 2.5 babies. Half (1.25) will be boys and half (1.25) will be girls. Add 1.25 boys to the 7.5 boys already born and 1.25 girls to the 7.5 already born. (Total babies: 17.5 with 8.75 boys and 8.75 girls).
</li>
<li>
And so on, maintianing a 50/50 population.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Where the truth is?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-155" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 155)</h4>
<p>The proportion of girls in one family is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator">biased estimator</a> of the proportion of girls in a population consisting of many families because you are underweighting the families with a large number of children.</p>
<p>If there were just 1 family, then your formula would be wrong, but the average of the percentage of girls you would observe would be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \bigg(\frac{n}{n+1}\bigg) = 1-\log2 = 30.69\%.\]</span></p>
<p>Half of the time, you would observe <span class="math inline">\(0\%\)</span> girls.</p>
<p>If you have multiple families, the average of the observed percentage of girls in the population will increase.</p>
<p>For 2 families, the average percentage of girls would be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n+1}{2^{n+2}} \bigg(\frac{n}{n+2}\bigg) = \log 4 - 1 = 38.63\%.\]</span></p>
<p>More generally, the average percentage for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> families is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{n+k-1 \choose k-1}{2^{n+k}} \bigg(\frac{n}{n+k}\bigg) = \frac{k}{2}\bigg(\psi(\frac{k+2}2)-\psi(\frac{k+1}2)\bigg)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digamma_function">digamma function</a> which satisfies</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[ \psi(m) = -\gamma + \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \frac1i = -\gamma + H_{m-1}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[ \psi(m+\frac12) = -\gamma -2\log 2 + \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{2}{2i-1}.\]</span>
</p>
<p>With a little work, one can verify that this goes to <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(k\to \infty\)</span>. So, for a large population such as a country, the official answer of <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> is approximately correct, although the explanation is misleading. In particular, for <span class="math inline">\(10\)</span> couples, the expected percentage of girls is <span class="math inline">\(10 \log 2 - 1627/252 = 47.51\%\)</span> contrary to what the official answer suggests. With <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> families, the expected proportion is about <span class="math inline">\(1/2 - 1/4k\)</span>.</p>
<p>It is not enough to argue that the expected number of boys equals the expected number of girls, since we want <span class="math inline">\(E[G/(G+B)] \ne E[G]/E[G+B].\)</span> Expectation is linear, but not multiplicative for dependent variables, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(G+B\)</span> are not independent even though <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 32)</h4>
<p>There is a closely related puzzle about cards. I was told it by Vin de Silva, who said he was told it by Imre Leader, but I have no idea what the original source is.</p>
<p>An ordinary deck of cards, face down, is placed in front of you in a stack. A dealer turns the top card of the stack face up and puts it on a separate pile, and does this repeatedly until you say “now”. At that point he turns over the next card and stops. You can say “now” at any time from the very beginning (before the first card is turned over) until almost the very end (just before the last card is turned over). You win if the last card turned over — the one turned over just after you say “now” — is red. What is the winning strategy?</p>
<p>You can get yourself into all sorts of convolutions trying to solve this. For example, you might think that it’s good to wait until lots of the cards revealed so far are black, because then the probability that the next card will be red is relatively high.</p>
<p>But the solution is that it makes no difference at all what you do. Your probability of winning is always 0.5. To see this easily, imagine that after you say “now”, the dealer turns over not the <em>top</em> card of the stack, but the <em>bottom</em> one. Clearly this game is equivalent to the original one, and clearly your probability of winning is 0.5 no matter what you do.</p>
<p>I’d like to take this easy solution and translate it into an equally compelling solution to the boy/girl puzzle, but right now I can’t see how.</p>

<p>For those who still don’t get it, it might help to consider this ultrasimplified example:</p>
<p>A certain family has a 3/4 chance of having 1 girl and a 1/4 chance of having 3 boys.</p>
<p>What is the expected number of girls in this family? 3/4. What is the expected number of boys? 3/4. What is the expected difference between the number of girls and the number of boys? Zero.</p>
<p>But what is the expected <em>fraction</em> of girl-births? There’s a 3/4 chance that it’s 100%, and a 1/4 chance that it’s 0%. Therefore the expected fraction is 75%. Which, notably, is not 50%.</p>
<p>Moral: Just because the expected difference is zero, you can’t conclude that the expected ratio is one.</p>
<p>(There is of course nothing new here beyond what Douglas Zare has already made crystal clear, but I’m thinking the starkness of the example might help.)</p>

<section id="question-17" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I am interested in magic tricks whose explanation requires deep mathematics. The trick should be one that would actually appeal to a layman. An example is the following: the magician asks Alice to choose two integers between 1 and 50 and add them. Then add the largest two of the three integers at hand. Then add the largest two again. Repeat this around ten times. Alice tells the magician her final number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. The magician then tells Alice the next number. This is done by computing <span class="math inline">\((1.61803398\cdots) n\)</span> and rounding to the nearest integer. The explanation is beyond the comprehension of a random mathematical layperson, but for a mathematician it is not very deep. Can anyone do better?</p>

<p>Five unrelated items:</p>
<h5>
Mobius strip
</h2>
<p>One of the best mathematical tricks is what happens when you cut a Mobius strip in the middle. (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bcm-kPIuHE&amp;NR=1" rel="noreferrer">Look here</a>) (And what happens when you cut it again, and when you cut it not in the middle.) This is truly mind boggling and magicians use it in their acts. And it reflects deep mathematics.</p>
<h5>
Diaconis mind reading trick
</h2>
<p>I also heard from Mark Gorseky this description of a mathematical based card game</p>
<p>“Mark described a card trick of Diaconis where he takes a deck of cards, gives it to a person at the end of the room, lets this person “cut” the deck and replace the two parts, then asks many other people do the same and then asks people to take one card each from the deck. Next Diaconis is trying to read the mind of the five people with the last cards by asking them to concentrate on the cards they have. To help him a little against noise coming from other minds he asks those with black cards to step forward. Then he guesses the cards each of the five people have.</p>
<p>Mark said that Diaconis likes to perform this magic with a crowd of magician since it violates the basic rule: “never let the cards out of your control”. This trick is performed (with a reduced deck of 32 cards) based on a simple linear feedback shift register. Since all the operations of cuting and pasting amount to cyclic permutations, the 5 red/black bits are enough to tell the cylic shift and no genuine mind reading is required.&quot;</p>
<p>I think there is a paper by Goresky and Klapper about a version of this magic and relations to shift registers.</p>
<h5>
The Link Illusion
</h2>
<p>
I heard a wonderful magic from Nahva De Shalit. You tie a string between the two hands of two people and link the two strings. The task is to get unlinked.
</p>
<p>This ties with <a href="http://www.bctcs.ac.uk/BCTCS2010/invited.html#a052" rel="noreferrer">what I heard</a> from Eric Demaine about the main principle behined many puzzles (Some of which he manufectured with his father whan he was six!)</p>
<h5>
Symmetry Illusion
</h2>
<p><a href="http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2010/02/02/the-ultimate-riddle/" rel="noreferrer">Sometimes</a> things are not as symmetric as they may look.</p>
<h5>
commutators-based magic
</h2>
<p>(I heard this from Eric Demaine and from Shahar Mozes.) If we hang a picture (or boxing gloves) with one nail, once the nail falls so does the picture. If we use two nails then ordinarily if one nails falls the picture can still hangs there. Mathematics can come for the rescue for the following important task: use five nails so that if any one nail falls so does the picture.</p>

<strong>Question:</strong> Do you have some experience/proposals of “games” which you can play with your children, which would be on the one hand would make some fun for them, on the other would somehow develop their logical/thinking/mathematical skills, and on the other hand would be of at least some interest for adult mathematicians ?

<h4>Answer accepted (score 113)</h4>
<p>One evening at the dinner table, when my oldest daughter was 3 or 4, I was in a teasing mood, and I called her a goose. She didn’t want to be a goose, so she refuted the claim, “I am not a goose!” Then I told her to prove me wrong. After some back and forth, she realized that her cause would benefit from some distinguishing feature: “A goose has feathers, but I don’t have feathers, so I’m not a goose.” I was impressed, so I chose not to continue the teasing by concluding she was a plucked goose.</p>
<p>So began our game “Prove me wrong,” in which I make wild claims for her to refute. In the modern version of the game, I will respond to her “proofs” with more refined claims. As a mathematician, it is quite the guilty pleasure to construct these logically sound but apparently absurd refinements. For the child, the game presents a fun way to navigate silly ideas. In the end, she’s refining her ability to apply basic logic.</p>
<p>On a good day, I will bring “Prove me wrong” into the classroom. When I introduce matrix multiplication in linear algebra, everyone has seen it before, and so I inject some “fun” by claiming that multiplication is commutative. The more outspoken students read my smile and speak up with an emphatic “No, it isn’t!” I then proceed to make my case by multiplying <span class="math inline">\(1\times 1\)</span> matrices and <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrices that happen to commute. Eventually, a student suggests that I put variables in the entries of my <span class="math inline">\(2\times 2\)</span> matrices.</p>

<p>The game “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(game)" rel="noreferrer">Set</a>” seems to fit the bill. It’s a card came where there are cards that show images which have four different features, each of which comes in three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
number (1, 2, or 3 objects)
</li>
<li>
color (green, blue, pink)
</li>
<li>
shape (diamonds, rounded rectangles, “tildes”)
</li>
<li>
filling (empty, filled, half-filled)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
so there are <span class="math inline">\(3^4 = 81\)</span> cards. You lay a certain number of card open on the table and the players need to find “sets” of cards, and a set are three cards such that on these three card each feature is either the same or all three versions appear. So, this picture shows a set: <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lh2us.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lh2us.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>
</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, you are looking for lines in four-dimensional space over three elements.</p>
<p>Granted, it’s not easy for 5year olds, but I’ve met some kids at that age who could play it and had fun.</p>
<hr>
<p>One successful way to play it with kids even as young as 4 is to first find the set yourself, and then hand two of the cards of it to the kid. And let them find the third card. You coach them along: “What color is this? What color is this (second card)? So, what color will the third card have to be?”</p>
<p>If it’s too hard for them, let them play with a reduced deck for a while: use all the solid cards only, to make a deck of 27 cards, and play with that. Then all the single-shape cards (again 27), so they get used to spotting differences of shading.</p>
<p>If you’re going to be playing with younger children for a while, you could consider getting <a href="https://www.setgame.com/setjunior" rel="noreferrer">Set Junior</a>. It only includes the solid cards, and the cards are thicker cardboard tiles. It also includes an easier variation, where one is just trying to match the cards in one’s hand to existing Sets on a game board.</p>

<p>Rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game is played by two players, starting with a few spots drawn on a sheet of paper. Players take turns, where each turn consists of drawing a line between two spots (or from a spot to itself) and adding a new spot somewhere along the line. The players are constrained by the following rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The line may be straight or curved, but must not touch or cross itself or any other line.</p></li>
<li><p>The new spot cannot be placed on top of one of the endpoints of the new line. Thus the new spot splits the line into two shorter lines.</p></li>
<li>No spot may have more than three lines attached to it. For the purposes of this rule, a line from the spot to itself counts as two attached lines and new spots are counted as having two lines already attached to them.</li>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I think/hope this is okay for MO.</p>
<p>I often find that textbooks provide very little in the way of motivation or context. As a simple example, consider group theory. Every textbook I have seen that talks about groups (including some very basic undergrad level books) presents them as abstract algebraic structures (while providing some examples, of course), then spends a few dozen pages proving theorems, and then maybe in some other section of the book covers some Galois Theory. This really irks me. Personally I find it very difficult to learn a topic with no motivation, partly just because it bores me to death. And of course it is historically backwards; groups arose as people tried to solve problems they were independently interested in. They didn’t sit down and prove a pile of theorems about groups and then realize that groups had applications. It’s also frustrating because I have to be completely passive; if I don’t know what groups are for or why anyone cares about them, all I can do is sit and read as the book throws theorems at me.</p>
<p>This is true not just with sweeping big picture issues, but with smaller things too. I remember really struggling to figure out why it was supposed to matter so much which subgroups were closed under conjugation before finally realizing that the real issue was which subgroups can be kernels of homomorphisms, and the other thing is just a handy way to characterize them. So why not define normal subgroups that way, or at least throw in a sentence explaining that that’s what we’re really after? But no one does.</p>
<p>I’ve heard everyone from freshmen to Fields Medal recipients complain about this, so I know I’m not alone. And yet these kinds of textbooks seem to be the norm.</p>
<p>So what I want to know is:</p>
<blockquote>
Why do authors write books like this?
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
How do others handle this situation?
</blockquote>
<p>Do you just struggle through? Get a different book? Talk to people? (Talking to people isn’t really an option for me until Fall…) Some people seem legitimately to be able to absorb mathematics quite well with no context at all. How?</p>

<p>By now the advice I give to students in math courses, whether they are math majors or not, is the following:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The goal is to learn how to <em>do</em> mathematics, not to “know” it.</p></li>
<li><p>Nobody ever learned much about doing something from either lectures or textbooks. The standard examples I always give are basketball and carpentry. Why is mathematics any different?</p></li>
<li><p>Lectures and textbooks serve an extremely important purpose: They show you what you need to learn. From them you learn what you need to learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on my own experience as both a student and a teacher, I have come to the conclusion that the best way to learn is through “guided struggle”. You have to do the work yourself, but you need someone else there to either help you over obstacles you can’t get around despite a lot of effort or provide you with some critical knowledge (usually the right perspective but sometimes a clever trick) you are missing. Without the prior effort by the student, the knowledge supplied by a teacher has much less impact.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A substitute for a teacher like that is a working group of students who are all struggling through the same material. When I was a graduate student, we had a wonderful working seminar on Sunday mornings with bagels and cream cheese, where I learned a lot about differential geometry and Lie groups with my classmates.</p>
<p>ADDED: So how do you learn from a book? I can’t speak for others, but I have never been able to read a math book forwards. I always read backwards. I always try to find a conclusion (a cool definition or theorem) that I really want to understand. Then I start working backwards and try to read the minimum possible to understand the desired conclusion. Also, I guess I have attention deficit disorder, because I rarely read straight through an entire proof or definition. I try to read the minimum possible that’s enough to give me the idea of what’s going on and then I try to fill the details myself. I’d rather spend my time writing my own definition or proof and doing my own calculations than reading what someone else wrote. The honest and embarrassing truth is that I fall asleep when I read math papers and books. What often happens is that as I’m trying to read someone else’s proof I ask myself, “Why are they doing this in such a complicated way? Why couldn’t you just….?” I then stop reading and try to do it the easier way. Occasionally, I actually succeed. More often, I develop a greater appreciation for the obstacles and become better motivated to read more.</p>
<p>WHAT’S THE POINT OF ALL THIS? I don’t think the solution is changing how math books are written. I actually prefer them to be terse and to the point. I fully agree that students should know more about the background and motivation of what they are learning. It annoys me that math students learn about calculus without understanding its real purpose in life or that math graduate students learn symplectic geometry without knowing anything about Hamiltonian mechanics. But it’s not clear to me that it is the job of a single textbook to provide all this context for a given subject. I <em>do</em> think that your average math book tries to cover too many different things. I think each math book should be relatively short and focus on one narrowly and clearly defined story. I believe if you do that, it will be easier to students to read more different math books.</p>

<p>Here are some words by Gromov that might be relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This common and unfortunate fact of the lack of an adequate presentation of basic ideas and motivations of almost any mathematical theory is, probably, due to the binary nature of mathematical perception: either you have no inkling of an idea or, once you have understood it, this very idea appears so embarrassingly obvious that you feel reluctant to say it aloud; moreover, once your mind switches from the state of darkness to the light, all memory of the dark state is erased and it becomes impossible to conceive the existence of another mind for which the idea appears nonobvious.

<h4>Answer 3 (score 68)</h4>
<p>I absolutely agree that this is a question worth asking. I have only recently come to realize that all of the abstract stuff I’ve been learning for the past few years, while interesting in its own right, has concrete applications in physics as well as in other branches of mathematics, none of which was ever mentioned to me in an abstract algebra course. For example, my understanding is that the origin of the term “torsion” to refer to elements of finite order in group theory comes from topology, where torsion in the integral homology of a compact surface tells you whether it’s orientable or not (hence whether, when it is constructed by identifying edges of a polygon, the edges must be <strong>twisted</strong> to fit together or not). Isn’t this a wonderful story? Why doesn’t it get told until so much later?</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, I solve this problem by getting a different book. For example, when I wanted to learn a little commutative algebra, I started out by reading Atiyah-Macdonald. But although A-M is a good and thorough reference in its own right, I didn’t feel like I was getting enough geometric intuition. So I found first Eisenbud, and then Reid, both of which are great at discussing the geometric side of the story even if they are not necessarily as thorough as A-M.</p>
<p>As for the first question, I have always wanted to blame this trend on Bourbaki, but maybe the origin of this style comes from the group of people around Hilbert, Noether, Artin, etc. Let me quote from the end of Reid, where he discusses this trend:</p>
<blockquote>
The abstract axiomatic methods in algebra are simple and clean and powerful, and give essentially for nothing results that could previously only be obtained by complicated calculations. The idea that you can throw out all the old stuff that made up the bulk of the university math teaching and replace it with more modern material that had previously been considered much too advanced has an obvious appeal. The new syllabus in algebra (and other subjects) was rapidly established as the new orthodoxy, and algebraists were soon committed to the abstract approach. <br><br> The problems were slow to emerge. I discuss what I see as two interrelated drawbacks: the divorce of algebra from the rest of the math world, and the unsuitability of the purely abstract approach in teaching a general undergraduate audience. The first of these is purely a matter of opinion - I consider it regrettable and unhealthy that the algebra seminar seems to form a ghetto with its own internal language, attitudes, criterions for success and mechanisms for reproduction, and no visible interest in what the rest of the world is doing.
</blockquote>
<p>To read the rest of Reid’s commentary you’ll have to get the book, which I highly recommend doing anyway.</p>

<p>I am surprised to see that so many people suggest meta-mathematical articles, which try to explain how one should do good mathematics in one or the other form. Personally, I usually find it a waste of time to read these, and there a few statements to which I agree so wholeheartedly as the one of Borel:</p>
<p>“I feel that what mathematics needs least are pundits who issue prescriptions or guidelines for presumably less enlightened mortals.”</p>
<p>The mere idea that you can learn how to do mathematics (or in fact anything useful) from reading a HowTo seems extremely weird to me. I would rather read any classical math article, and there are plenty of them. The subject does not really matter, you can learn good mathematical thinking from each of them, and in my opinion much easier than from any of the above guideline articles. Just to be constructive, take for example (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li>
Atiyah&amp;Bott, The Yang-Mills equations over Riemann surfaces.
</li>
<li>
Borel, Sur la cohomologie des espaces fibrés principaux et des espaces homogènes de groupes de Lie compacts.

<li>
Gromov,Groups of polynomial growth and expanding maps.

<li>
Tate, Fourier analysis in number fields and Hecke’s zeta-functions.

</ul>
<p>I am not suggesting that any mathematician should read all of them, but any one of them will do. In fact, the actual content of these papers does not matter so much. It is rather, that they give an insight how a new idea is born. So, if you want to give birth to new ideas yourself, look at them, not at some guideline.</p>

<p>
The Busemann-Petty problem (posed in 1956) has an interesting history. It asks the following question: if <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> are two origin-symmetric convex bodies in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> such that the volume of each central hyperplane section of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is less than the volume of the corresponding section of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\operatorname{Vol}_{n-1}(K\cap \xi^\perp)\le \operatorname{Vol}_{n-1}(L\cap \xi^\perp)\qquad\text{for all } \xi\in S^{n-1},\]</span> does it follow that the volume of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is less than the volume of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Vol}_n(K)\le \operatorname{Vol}_n(L)?\)</span>
</p>
<p>Many mathematician’s gut reaction to the question is that the answer must be yes and Minkowski’s uniqueness theorem provides some mathematical justification for such a belief—Minkwoski’s uniqueness theorem implies that an origin-symmetric star body in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is completely determined by the volumes of its central hyperplane sections, so these volumes of central hyperplane sections <em>do</em> contain a vast amount of information about the bodies. It was widely believed that the answer to the Busemann-Problem must be true, even though it was still a largely unopened conjecture.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in 1975 everyone was caught off-guard when Larman and Rogers produced a counter-example showing that the assertion is false in <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 12\)</span> dimensions. Their counter-example was quite complicated, but in 1986, Keith Ball proved that the maximum hyperplane section of the unit cube is <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span> regardless of the dimension, and a consequence of this is that the centered unit cube and a centered ball of suitable radius provide a counter-example when <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 10\)</span>. Some time later Giannopoulos and Bourgain (independently) gave counter-examples for <span class="math inline">\(n\ge 7\)</span>, and then Papadimitrakis and Gardner (independently) gave counter-examples for <span class="math inline">\(n=5,6\)</span>.</p>
<p>
By 1992 only the three and four dimensional cases of the Busemann-Petty problem remained unsolved, since the problem is trivially true in two dimensions and by that point counter-examples had been found for all <span class="math inline">\(n\ge 5\)</span>. Around this time theory had been developed connecting the problem with the notion of an “intersection body”. Lutwak proved that if the body with smaller sections is an intersection body then the conclusion of the Busemann-Petty problem follows. Later work by Grinberg, Rivin, Gardner, and Zhang strengthened the connection and established that the Busemann-Petty problem has an affirmative answer in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> iff every origin-symmetric convex body in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is an intersection body. But the question of whether a body is an intersection body is closely related to the positivity of the inverse spherical Radon transform. In 1994, Richard Gardner used geometric methods to invert the spherical Radon transform in three dimensions in such a way to prove that the problem has an <em>affirmative</em> answer in three dimensions (which was surprising since all of the results up to that point had been <em>negative</em>). Then in 1994, Gaoyong Zhang published a paper (in the Annals of Mathematics) which claimed to prove that the unit cube in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^4\)</span> is not an intersection body and as a consequence that the problem has a negative answer in <span class="math inline">\(n=4\)</span>.
</p>
<p>For three years everyone believed the problem had been solved, but in 1997 Alexander Koldobsky (who was working on completely different problems) provided a new Fourier analytic approach to convex bodies and in particular established a very convenient Fourier analytic characterization of intersection bodies. Using his new characterization he showed that the unit cube in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^4\)</span> <em>is</em> an intersection body, contradicting Zhang’s earlier claim. It turned out that Zhang’s paper was incorrect and this re-opened the Busemann-Petty problem again.</p>
<p>After learning that Koldobsky’s results contradicted his claims, Zhang quickly proved that in fact every origin-symmetric convex body in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^4\)</span> <em>is</em> an intersection body and hence that the Busemann-Petty problem has an affirmative answer in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^4\)</span>—the opposite of what he had previously claimed. This later paper was also published in the Annals, and so Zhang may be perhaps the only person to have published in such a prestigious journal both that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and that <span class="math inline">\(\neg P\)</span>!</p>

<p>Mathematicians used to hold plenty of false, but intuitively reasonable, ideas in analysis that were backed up with proofs of one kind or another (understood in the context of those times). Coming to terms with the counterexamples led to important new ideas in analysis.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
A convergent infinite series of continuous functions is continuous. Cauchy gave a proof of this (1821). See Theorem 1 in Cours D’Analyse Chap. VI Section 1. Five years later Abel pointed out that certain Fourier series are counterexamples. A consequence is that the concept of <em>uniform convergence</em> was isolated and, going back to Cauchy’s proof, it was seen that he had really proved a uniformly convergent series of continuous functions is continuous. For a nice discussion of this as an educational tool, see <a href="http://fredrickey.info/hm/CalcNotes/CauchyWrgPr.pdf" rel="noreferrer">“Cauchy’s Famous Wrong Proof” by V. Fred Rickey</a>. [Edit: This may not be historically fair to Cauchy. See Graviton’s answer for another assessment of Cauchy’s work, which operated with continuity using infinitesimals in such a way that Abel’s counterexample was not a counterexample to Cauchy’s theorem.]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Lagrange, in the late 18th century, believed any function could be expanded into a power series except at some isolated points and wrote an entire book on analysis based on this assumption. (This was a time when there wasn’t a modern definition of function; it was just a “formula”.) His goal was to develop analysis without using infinitesmals or limits. This approach to analysis was influential for quite a few years. See Section 4.7 of Jahnke’s “A History of Analysis”. Work in the 19th century, e.g., Dirichlet’s better definition of function, blew the whole work of Lagrange apart, although in a reverse historical sense Lagrange was saved since the title of his book is “Theory of Analytic Functions…”
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Any continuous function (on a real interval, with real values) is differentiable except at some isolated points. Ampere gave a proof (1806) and the claim was repeated in lots of 19th century calculus books. See pp. 43–44, esp. footnote 11 on page 44, of Hawkins’s book “Lebesgue’s theory of integration: its origins and development”. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oV1aLqag6WwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=Ampere+1806&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lV-HfqHza5&amp;sig=Q_3U85rv2o8YEok--GjYWeJSZPs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-BZmTLm8CIL-8Aatpon8Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ampere%201806&amp;f=false" rel="noreferrer">Here is a Google Books link</a>. In 1872 Weierstrass killed the whole idea with his continuous nowhere differentiable function, which was one of the first fractal curves in mathematics. For a survey of different constructions of such functions, see <a href="https://pure.ltu.se/ws/files/30923977/LTU-EX-03320-SE.pdf" rel="noreferrer">“Continuous Nowhere Differentiable Functions” by Johan Thim</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A solution to an elliptic PDE with a given boundary condition could be solved by minimizing an associated “energy” functional which is always nonnegative. It could be shown that <em>if</em> the associated functional achieved a minimum at some function, then that function was a solution to a certain PDE, and the minimizer was believed to exist for the false reason that any set of nonnegative numbers has an infimum. Dirichlet gave an electrostatic argument to justify this method, and Riemann accepted it and made significant use of it in his development of complex analysis (e.g., proof of Riemann mapping theorem). Weierstrass presented a counterexample to the Dirichlet principle in 1870: a certain energy functional could have infimum 0 with there being no function in the function space under study at which the functional is 0. This led to <em>decades</em> of uncertainty about whether results in complex analysis or PDEs obtained from Dirichlet’s principle were valid. In 1900 Hilbert finally justified Dirichlet’s principle as a valid method in the calculus of variations, and the wider classes of function spaces in which Dirichlet’s principle would be valid eventually led to Sobolev spaces. A book on this whole story is A. F. Monna, “Dirichlet’s principle: A mathematical comedy of errors and its influence on the development of analysis” (1975), which is <em>not</em> reviewed on MathSciNet.

The (in)famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_conjecture">Jacobian Conjecture</a> was considered a theorem since a 1939 publication by Keller (who claimed to prove it). Then Shafarevich found a new proof and published it in some conference proceedings paper (in early 1950-ies). This conjecture states that any polynomial map from C^2 to C^2 is invertible if its Jacobian is nowhere zero. In 1960-ies, Vitushkin found a counterexample to all the proofs known to date, by constructing a complex analytic map, not invertible and with nowhere vanishing Jacobian. It is still a main source of embarrassment for arxiv.org contributors, who publish about 3-5 false proofs yearly.

<h3>25: What practical applications does set theory have? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/10334.html">76603</a> in 2017)</h3>
<section id="question-24" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>
I am a non-mathematician. I’m reading up on set theory. It’s fascinating, but I wonder if it’s found any ‘real-world’ applications yet. For instance, in high school when we were learning the properties of <em>i</em>, a lot of the kids wondered what it was used for. The teacher responded that it was used to describe the properties of electricity in circuits. So is there a similar practical app of set theory? Something we wouldn’t be able to do or build without set theory?
<HR>
Edit: Actually, I’m asking about the practicality of the knowledge of the properties of infinite sets, and their cardinality. I’m reading Peter Suber’s <a href="http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/infapp.htm" rel="noreferrer">A Crash Course in the Mathematics Of Infinite Sets</a>. The properties of infinite sets seem unintuitive, but of course, the proofs show that they are true.
</p>
<p>My guess is that whoever came up with the square root of -1 did so many years before it ‘escaped’ from mathematics and found a practical use. Before then perhaps people thought it was clever, but not necessarily useful or even ‘true’. So then, if you need to understand electricity, and you can do it best by using <em>i</em>, then even someone who thinks it’s silly to have a square root of negative -1 would have to grudgingly admit that there’s some ‘reality’ to it, despite its unintuitiveness, because electricity behaves as if it ‘exists’.</p>
<p>Seeing as how there was so much resistance to infinite sets at the beginning, even among mathematicians, I wonder: has the math of infinite sets been ‘proven worthwhile’ by having a practical application outside of mathematics, so that no one can say it’s just some imaginative games?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-48" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 48)</h4>
<p>The purpose of set theory is not practical application in the same way that, for example, Fourier analysis has practical applications. To most mathematicians (i.e. those who are not themselves set theorists), the value of set theory is not in any particular theorem but in the <strong>language</strong> it gives us. Nowadays even computer scientists describe their basic concept - Turing machines - in the language of set theory. This is useful because when you specify an object set-theoretically there is no question what you are talking about and you can unambiguously answer any questions you might have about it. Without precise definitions it is very difficult to do any serious mathematics.</p>
<p>I guess another important point here is that it is hard to appreciate the role of set theory in mathematics without knowing some of the history behind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_mathematics#Foundational_crisis">crisis of foundations</a> in mathematics, but I don’t know any particularly good references.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your second question is more specific, so I’ll give a more specific answer: to thoroughly understand the mathematics behind, say, modern physics does in fact require (among many other things) that you understand the properties of infinite sets because <strong>topology</strong> has become an important part of this mathematics, and understanding general topology depends heavily on understanding properties of infinite sets. Whether this means that set theory has any bearing on “reality” depends on how much faith you have in topological spaces as a good model for the real world.</p>
<p>As a specific example, the mathematics behind general relativity is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_geometry">differential geometry</a>. I think it’s fair to say the development of general relativity would have been impossible without the mathematical language to express it. Differential geometry takes place on special kinds of manifolds, which are special kinds of topological spaces. So to understand differential geometry you need to understand at least some topology. And I don’t think I need to justify the usefulness of general relativity!</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 35)</h4>
<p>There are many uses of infinite sets and their properties. Let me just give you a specific one from computer science. One important task in computer science is proving or verifying that programs do what they are supposed to do. When such programs involve loops and recursive calls (self-reference), we need methods for showing that the loops and recursive calls terminate, i.e., that the program won’t run forever. The usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction" rel="noreferrer">induction principle for natural numbers</a> suffices for showing that a single loop terminates, but we need double induction for double loops, triple induction for triple loops, etc. The whole business can get very complicated when the program is more than just a simple combination of loops. Set theory helps sort it all out with the principle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_induction" rel="noreferrer">transfinite induction</a> and the calculus of (infinite) ordinal numbers. Transfinite induction covers all possible ways in which one could show that a program terminates, while the ordinal numbers are used to express how complex the proof of termination is (the bigger the number, the more complicated it is to see that the program will actually terminate).</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 28)</h4>
<p>Set theory is an extremely convenient language for being able to rigorously define and manipulate various “completed infinities” - not only just infinite sets such as the natural numbers or real numbers, but much “larger” completed infinities, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93%C4%8Cech_compactification" rel="noreferrer">Stone-Cech compactifications</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number" rel="noreferrer">hyperreals</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrafilter" rel="noreferrer">ultrafilters</a>, that typically need some fairly powerful set-theoretic tools, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorn%27s_lemma" rel="noreferrer">Zorn’s lemma</a>, to construct. One can often get by in applications using various “incomplete” and/or “finitary” substitutes for these objects, which require less set-theoretic machinery to set up (e.g. one may be able to largely avoid use of the axiom of choice), but the mathematics can become much messier when doing so.</p>
<p>Once one has set up a non-trivial amount of mathematics in the realm of infinite or continuous spaces, one can often derive finitary consequences (at least at a qualitative level) by using further tools such as compactness arguments or nonstandard analysis, which again are most easily discussed if one is working within a set theoretic framework. A good example of this is the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/10/254a-lecture-10-the-furstenberg-correspondence-principle/" rel="noreferrer">Furstenberg correspondence principle</a> that allows one to derive combinatorial statements about finite sets of integers using the infinitary language of ergodic theory, which can require a non-trivial amount of set theory to work with (e.g. when using tools such as disintegration of measures with respect to a sigma algebra). I am personally fond of using the technique of ultrafilters (or nonstandard analysis) as a bridge between the finitary world of “practical” mathematics and the infinitary world described by set theory, as discussed for instance in <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2013/12/07/ultraproducts-as-a-bridge-between-discrete-and-continuous-analysis/" rel="noreferrer">this blog post of mine</a>.</p>
<p>(One important caveat though: if one directly uses tools such as ultrafilters or compactness to transfer infinitary results to finitary results, one often ends up with conclusions that are qualitative in nature, or quantitative only with extremely poor explicit bounds. Often, additional effort is then required to obtain quantitative finitary results with bounds that are effective enough to be useful in real-world applications. Nevertheless, the infinitary results can show the way forward, and serve as an excellent source of analogy and intuition to then develop a satisfactory quantitative finitary theory.)</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I am looking for mathematical documentaries, both technical and non-technical. They should be “interesting” in that they present either actual mathematics, mathematicians or history of mathematics. I am in charge of nourishing our departmental math library (PUCV) and I would like to add this kind of material in order to attract undergraduates toward mathematics. For this reason, I am not looking for videos of conferences or seminar talks, but rather for introductory or “wide public” material.</p>
<p>Here are some good examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
“Dimensions”, by Leys, Ghys &amp; Alvarez, <a href="http://www.dimensions-math.org/">http://www.dimensions-math.org/</a> which explains actual maths and is excellent.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“Julia Robinson and Hilbert’s tenth problem”, <a href="https://www.vismath.eu/en/films/julia-robinson">https://www.vismath.eu/en/films/julia-robinson</a>, about the life of some great mathematicians.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
BBC documentary on “Fermat’s last theorem” (by the way, any information about how to purchase it would be welcome, it does not seem to be possible to do it from the BBC site <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0074rxx/horizon-19951996-fermats-last-theorem">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b0074rxx/horizon-19951996-fermats-last-theorem</a>.

<h3>27: Which are the best mathematics journals, and what are the differences between them? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/42.html">73650</a> in 2016)</h3>
<section id="question-26" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Suppose you have a draft paper that you think is pretty good, and people tell you that you should submit it to a top journal. How do you work out where to send it to?</p>
<p>Coming up with a shortlist isn’t very hard. If you look for generalist journals, it probably begins:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ams.org/jams/">Journal of the American Mathematical Society</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://annals.math.princeton.edu/about">Annals of Mathematics</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.springer.com/math/journal/222">Inventiones</a>
</li>
<li>
…?
</li>
</ul>
<p>How do you begin deciding amongst such a list, however? I know that you can look up <a href="http://www.eigenfactor.org/methods.htm">eigenfactors</a> and <a href="http://www.ams.org/membership/journal-survey.pdf">page counts</a>, and you should also look for relevant editors and perhaps hope for fast turn around times. Depending on your politics, you might also ask how evil the journal’s publisher is.</p>
<p>But for most people thinking about submitting to a good journal, these aren’t really the right metrics. What I’d love to hear is something like “A tends to take this sort of articles, while B prefers X, Y and Z.” This sort of information is surprisingly hard to find on the internet.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-41" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 41)</h4>
<p>I would personally add Acta Mathematica and Publications mathématiques de l’IHES to the short list.</p>
<p>It is possible to give some particularities of those five journals. For example, Publications de l’IHES is able to publish very long papers (up to 200-250 pages) while there are less common in other journals. Inventiones publishes more papers each year than the other, so it might be a little less selective (although it obviously publishes many top papers). Acta is somewhat shifted toward analysis.</p>
<p>I guess that the best criterion is still the editorial board, as Andy Putman suggested. The probability that your paper is turned down for bad reasons (what I call a false negative answer) is lower when it is handled by an editor that is interested.</p>

<p>For submitting papers to “top” journals, I think the most important thing is to submit to an editor who is familiar with your subfield. Having an editor who can pick an appropriate referee and then understand the report enough to advocate for your paper is essential.</p>
<p>Also, I think it is very important to ask your mentors where you should submit and also which editors would be best.</p>

<h3>28: Where to buy premium white chalk in the U.S., like they have at RIMS? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/26267.html">71745</a> in 2010)</h3>
<section id="question-27" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>While not a research-level math question, I’m sure this is a question of interest to many research-level mathematicians, whose expertise I seek.</p>
<p>At RIMS (in Kyoto) in 2005, they had the best white chalk I’ve seen anywhere. It’s slightly larger than standard American chalk, harder, heavier, and most importantly covered with some enamel-like coating that one must rub through (on the end) to be able to write with. One’s hands don’t rub through the coating, and thus don’t get chalky.</p>
<p>Are there any U.S. manufacturers of such?</p>
<p>EDIT: even though someone has given a link whereby to order this stuff from Japan, I would still be delighted to hear about American products that beat Binney &amp; Smith.</p>

<p>The chalk was “smuggled” in stick by stick carried in the beaks of birds (well, practically), so the supply is very limited. We have, however, worked out a distribution system that seems the fairest and that should allow our stash to last for about 3 semesters. Faculty members teaching at GC will get ten sticks of chalk per semester, and those not teaching but who are coordinating (or co-coordinating) a math seminar at the GC and is a member of the Math Doctoral Faculty will each get 2 sticks per semester. This will repeat each semester until the chalk is gone. Faculty should save this chalk for use only during their most important lectures or when working on their most important theorems.</p>

<p>
I’d start with Lee’s <strong>Introduction to Smooth Manifolds</strong>. It covers the basics in a modern, clear and rigorous manner. Topics covered include the basics of smooth manifolds, smooth vector bundles, submersions, immersions, embeddings, Whitney’s embedding theorem, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, Lie derivatives, integration on manifolds, Lie groups, and Lie algebras.
</p>
<p>
After finishing with Lee, I’d move on to Hirsch’s <strong>Differential Topology</strong>. This is more advanced then Lee and leans more towards topology. Also, the proofs are much more brief then those of Lee and Hirsch contains many more typos than Lee. The topics covered include the basics of smooth manifolds, function spaces (odd but welcome for books of this class), transversality, vector bundles, tubular neighborhoods, collars, map degree, intersection numbers, Morse theory, cobordisms, isotopies, and classification of two dimensional surfaces.
</p>
<p>
These two should get you through the basics. However, if that is not enough, I’d move on to Kosinski’s <strong>Differential Manifolds</strong> which covers the basics of smooth manifolds, submersions, immersions, embeddings, normal bundles, tubular neighborhoods, transversality, foliations, handle presentation theorem, h-cobordism theorem, framed manifolds, and surgery on manifolds.

<section id="answer-accepted-score-25" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 25)</h4>
<p>Here is a heuristic point of view from engineering considerations. I must confess I do not fully know the mathematical reasons.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to consider <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span>, a function of time, <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Imagine that as we look at the direction of positive <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-axis, the graph of <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> s like looking behind to the trail <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> left in time. If you do not care about the future, ie the case <span class="math inline">\(t &amp;lt; 0\)</span>, then it makes sense to use Laplace transform, because the transform integral goes from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>. On the other hand, if you care about the future also, it makes more sense to consider the Fourier transform. The transformation integral here goes from <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>So if you want to include future in your analysis, then Fourier transform is the way. This makes sense in electrical engineering applications for example, where you consider sinusoidal signals and you have an idea of what is going to come.</p>
<p>However for some physical systems, you only have the data of what happened until then. And you want all your analysis to be based on this, without predicting the future. Then Laplace transforms is the way.</p>
<p>If you do not care about the future, ie if you can declare <span class="math inline">\(f(t) = 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t &amp;lt; 0\)</span>, then the Laplace and Fourier transforms coincide: The Fourier transform is nothing but the Laplace transform evaluated on the imaginary axis. Such systems are called causal systems: the response depends only on what happened so far. This a terminology from control systems or signal processing.</p>
<p>For control systems engineering, stability of electrical networks, etc., Laplace transformation defines a more natural transfer function, and is easier to deal with, and the poles and zeros would immediately tell you about the stability of the network under consideration. Here we use Laplace transforms rather than Fourier, since its integral is simpler.</p>
<p>For instances where you look at the “frequency components”, “spectrum”, etc., Fourier analysis is always the best. The Fourier transform is simply the frequency spectrum of a signal. If you know that the sin/cos/complex exponentials would behave nicely, you might as well want to express a function in terms of these and observe how it behaves then.</p>
<p>Another example is solving the wave equation. Fourier himself used Fourier series/transforms for heat conduction problems.</p>

<p>Laplace transforms appear in physics because of causality: a response function <span class="math inline">\(R(t-t&#39;)\)</span> which gives the response at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to a force at time <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> should vanish for <span class="math inline">\(t\lt t&#39;\)</span>, in order not to violate the temporal relation between cause and effect. Because <span class="math inline">\(R(t)=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(t&amp;lt;0\)</span> its integral transform is the Laplace rather than the Fourier transform.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 5)</h4>
<p>For typical practical usage it is essential to know what properties has the system you are trying to describe. Usually you are able even get some insights about possible shape of solution before you really solve equations, only by means of symmetry considerations. So then you have to consider one or another transform not because of formal effectiveness, but because your solution has to have practical interpretation! What do you do with solution if you do not have any interpretation for example for coefficients of equations you get?</p>
<p>Fourier transformation sometimes has physical interpretation, for example for some mechanical models where we have quasi-periodic solutions ( usually because of symmetry of the system) Fourier transformations gives you normal modes of oscillations. Sometimes even for nonlinear system, couplings between such oscillations are weak so nonlinearity may be approximated by power series in Fourier space. Many systems has discrete spatial symmetry ( crystals) then solutions of equations has to be periodic so FT is quite natural ( for example in Quantum mechanics). With any of normal modes you may tie finite energy, sometimes momentum etc. invariants of motion. So during evolution, for linear system, such modes do not couple each other, and system in one of this state leaves in it forever. Every linear physical system has its spectrum of normal modes, and if coupled with some external random source of energy ( white noise), its evolution runs through such states from the lowest possible energy to the greatest.</p>
<p>It depends on initial conditions and boundary values and restrictions but for finite systems and linear equations Fourier Transform gives you transformation from linear differential equation to matrix one ( which is nearly always soluble and has clear theory and meaning) whilst Laplace Transform from DE to algebraic one with all advantages and disadvantages of it.</p>
<p>Laplace transform gives you solution in terms of decaying exponents so it is quite useful in relaxation processes, but it has no physical interpretation, usually no invariants are connected to any “vectors” of such representation, there is no discrete version of such transform with physical meaning. It is used in various engineering problems such that electrical circuits, queue theory etc. many equations in diffusion processes has easy Laplace transform solutions.</p>
<p>Definitely it would be easier to advice you what method of solution to use if you would describe what is the process you are trying to describe.</p>
<p>References: try to Google such words: energy spectrum, normal modes, eigenstates, eigenvectors in context of linear differential equations - solving DE by means of integral transforms in practical way is usually described in books on Mathematical Methods in Physics, and is connected to response functions, distribution theory, Hilbert and Banach functional spaces etc. It is very very broad area. What is more, if you asking in specific context ( for example in context of stochastic processes, or quantum mechanics) , then probably you are looking for some certain <strong>interpretation</strong> of such transforms and not for formal theory. This differences sometimes tricky because mount of mathematical books focus on existence theorems etc. which for many applications are obvious ( providing we have working, well formulated model, which ususaly we have!)</p>
<p>It is very difficult to get one useful reference without knowledge of area of application, because its are is such frequently used method! In analogue on mathematics level is like ask for application of metric spaces, or Stokes theorem and its meaning: it so broad area that probably you may just put in in every other area ad it fit! Nearly every Quantum Mechanics book will have explanation and interpretation of Fourier method. Laplace transform will be used in every books regarding signal processing! Many of them have very well and practical introduction to such methods. I prefer physical books, for example Byron Fuller “Mathematical Methods of Physics” for intermediate level.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>What are the most important applications <em>outside</em> of mathematics of each of the major fields of mathematics? For concreteness, let’s divide up mathematics according to <a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/categories/math">arxiv mathematics categories</a>, e.g. math.AT, math.QA, math.CO, etc.</p>
<p>This is a community-wiki question, so please edit and improve pre-existing answers: let’s keep it to a <strong>single answer for each subject area.</strong></p>
<p>(This is inspired by Terry Tao’s <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/10/25/applications-oriented-periodic-table/">recent post</a> about a periodic table of the elements listing commercial applications. He suggested it might be fun to have such a summary for either the MSC top-level subjects or the arxiv subjects.)</p>
<p>I’d like to propose that for areas in which the applications are either numerous, non-obvious, or generally worthy of discussion, someone volunteers to open up a new question specifically about that subject area, and takes care of providing a summary here of the best answers produced there.</p>

<p>Suresh suggested DFS, MRA pointed out that it’s not clear that works. Here’s my attempt at a solution following that thread of comments. If the graph has <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> nodes, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> paths from the source <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to the target <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, then the algorithm below prints all paths in time <span class="math inline">\(O((np+1)(m+n))\)</span>. (In particular, it takes <span class="math inline">\(O(m+n)\)</span> time to notice that there is no path.)</p>
<p>The idea is very simple: Do an exhaustive search, but bail early if you’ve gotten yourself into a corner.</p>
<p>Without bailing early, MRA’s counter-example shows that exhaustive search spends <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(n!)\)</span> time even if <span class="math inline">\(p=1\)</span>: The node <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> has only one adjacent edge and its neighbor is node <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, which is part of a complete (sub)graph <span class="math inline">\(K_{n-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Push s on the path stack and call search(s):</p>
<pre class="text"><code>path // is a stack (initially empty)
seen // is a set

def stuck(x)
   if x == t
     return False
   for each neighbor y of x
     if y not in seen
       insert y in seen
       if !stuck(y)
         return False
   return True

def search(x)

  seen = set(path)
  if stuck(x)
    return
  for each neighbor y of x
    push y on the path
    search(y)
    pop y from the path</code></pre>
<p>Here <em>search</em> does the exhaustive search and <em>stuck</em> could be implemented in DFS style (as here) or in BFS style.</p>

<h3>34: Why do we teach calculus students the derivative as a limit? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/40082.html">67079</a> in 2014)</h3>
<section id="question-33" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I’m not teaching calculus right now, but I talk to someone who does, and the question that came up is why emphasize the <span class="math inline">\(h \to 0\)</span> definition of a derivative to calculus students?</p>
<p>Something a teacher might do is ask students to calculate the derivative of a function like <span class="math inline">\(3x^2\)</span> using this definition on an exam, but it makes me wonder what the point of doing something like that is. Once one sees the definition and learns the basic rules, you can basically calculate the derivative of a lot of reasonable functions quickly. I tried to turn that around and ask myself if there are good examples of a function (that calculus students would understand) where there isn’t already a well-established rule for taking the derivative. The best I could come up with is a piecewise defined function, but that’s no good at all.</p>
<p>More practically, this question came up because when trying to get students to do this, they seemed rather impatient (and maybe angry?) at why they couldn’t use the “shortcut” (that they learned from friends or whatever).</p>
<p>So here’s an actual question:</p>
<p>What benefit is there in emphasizing (or even introducing) to calculus students the <span class="math inline">\(h \to 0\)</span> definition of a derivative (presuming there is a better way to do this?) and secondly, does anyone out there actually use this definition to calculate a derivative that couldn’t be obtained by a known symbolic rule? I’d prefer a function whose definition could be understood by a student studying first-year calculus.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say that this is bad (or good), I just couldn’t come up with any good reasons one way or the other myself.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I appreciate all of the responses, but I think my question as posed is too vague. I was worried about being too specific, so let me just tell you the context and apologize for misleading the discussion. This is about teaching first-semester calculus to students straight out of high school in the US, most of whom have already taken a calculus course in high school (and didn’t do well or retake it for whatever reason). These are mostly students who have no interest in mathematics (the cause for this is a different discussion I guess) and usually are only taking calculus to fulfill some university requirement. So their view of the instructor trying to get them to learn how to calculate derivatives from the definition on an assignment or on an exam is that they are just making them learn some long, arbitrary way of something that they already have better tools for.</p>
<p>I apologize but I don’t really accept the answer of “we teach the limit definition because we need a definition and that’s how we do mathematics”. I know I am being unfair in my paraphrasing, and I am NOT trying to say that we should not teach definitions. I was trying to understand how one answers the students’ common question: “Why can’t we just do this the easy way?” (and this was an overwhelming response on a recent mini-evaluation given to them). I like the answer of <span class="math inline">\(\exp(-1/x^2)\)</span> for the purpose of this question though.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get students to take you seriously when they think that you’re only interested in making them jump through hoops. As a more extreme example, I recall that as an undergraduate, some of my friends who took first year calculus (depending on the instructor) were given an oral exam at the end of the semester in which they would have to give a proof of one of 10 preselected theorems from the class. This seemed completely pointless to me and would only further isolate students from being interested in math, so why are things like this done?</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for wasting a lot of your time with my poorly-phrased question. I know MathOverflow is not a place for discussions, and I don’t want this to degenerate into one, so sorry again and I’ll accept an answer (though there were many good ones addressing different points).</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-123" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 123)</h4>
<p>This is a good question, given the way calculus is currently taught, which for me says more about the sad state of math education, rather than the material itself. All calculus textbooks and teachers claim that they are trying to teach what calculus is and how to use it. However, in the end most exams test mostly for the students’ ability to turn a word problem into a formula and find the symbolic derivative for that formula. So it is not surprising that virtually all students and not a few teachers believe that calculus means symbolic differentiation and integration.</p>
<p>My view is almost exactly the opposite. I would like to see symbolic manipulation banished from, say, the first semester of calculus. Instead, I would like to see the first semester focused purely on what the derivative and definite integral (<em>not</em> the indefinite integral) are and what they are useful for. If you’re not sure how this is possible without all the rules of differentiation and antidifferentiation, I suggest you take a look at the infamous “Harvard Calculus” textbook by Hughes-Hallett et al. This for me and despite all the furor it created is by far the best modern calculus textbook out there, because it actually tries to teach students calculus as a useful tool rather than a set of mysterious rules that miraculously solve a canned set of problems.</p>
<p>I also dislike introducing the definition of a derivative using standard mathematical terminology such as “limit” and notation such as <span class="math inline">\(h\rightarrow 0\)</span>. Another achievement of the Harvard Calculus book was to write a math textbook in plain English. Of course, this led to severe criticism that it was too “warm and fuzzy”, but I totally disagree.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important insight that the Harvard Calculus team had was that the key reason students don’t understand calculus is because they don’t really know what a function is. Most students believe a function is a formula and nothing more. I now tell my students to forget everything they were ever told about functions and tell them just to remember that a function is a box, where if you feed it an input (in calculus it will be a single number), it will spit out an output (in calculus it will be a single number).</p>
<p>Finally, (I could write on this topic for a long time. If for some reason you want to read me, just google my name with “calculus”) I dislike the word “derivative”, which provides no hint of what a derivative is. My suggested replacement name is “sensitivity”. The derivative measures the sensitivity of a function. In particular, it measures how sensitive the output is to small changes in the input. It is given by the ratio, where the denominator is the change in the input and the numerator is the induced change in the output. With this definition, it is not hard to show students why knowing the derivative can be very useful in many different contexts.</p>
<p>Defining the definite integral is even easier. With these definitions, explaining what the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is and why you need it is also easy.</p>
<p>Only after I have made sure that students really understand what functions, derivatives, and definite integrals are would I broach the subject of symbolic computation. What everybody should try to remember is that symbolic computation is only one and not necessarily the most important tool in the discipline of calculus, which itself is also merely a useful mathematical tool.</p>
<p>ADDED: What I think most mathematicians overlook is how large a conceptual leap it is to start studying functions (which is really a process) as mathematical objects, rather than just numbers. Until you give this its due respect and take the time to guide your students carefully through this conceptual leap, your students will never really appreciate how powerful calculus really is.</p>
<p>ADDED: I see that the function <span class="math inline">\(\theta\mapsto \sin\theta\)</span> is being mentioned. I would like to point out a simple question that very few calculus students and even teachers can answer correctly: Is the derivative of the sine function, where the angle is measured in degrees, the same as the derivative of the sine function, where the angle is measured in radians. In my department we audition all candidates for teaching calculus and often ask this question. So many people, including some with Ph.D.’s from good schools, couldn’t answer this properly that I even tried it on a few really famous mathematicians. Again, the difficulty we all have with this question is for me a sign of how badly we ourselves learn calculus. Note, however, that if you use the definitions of function and derivative I give above, the answer is rather easy.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 86)</h4>
<p>I’m teaching Calc 1 this semester, and I’ve stumbled onto something that I like very much.</p>
<p>First of all, I start (always) by having my students draw bunches of tangent lines to graphs, compute slopes and draw the “slope graphs” (they also do “area graphs”, but that’s not relevant to this answer). They build up a bit of intuition about slope and slope graphs.</p>
<p>Then (after a few days of this) I ask them to give me unambiguous instructions about how to draw a tangent line. They find, of course, that they are stumped.</p>
<p>In the past, I went from this to saying “we can’t get a tangent line, but maybe we can get an approximately tangent line” and develop the limit formula.</p>
<p>This semester, I said, “we have an intuitive notion of tangency; suppose someone offered a definition of tangency – what properties would it satisfy?” We had a discussion with the following result: tangency at point <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> should satisfy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
tangency (of one function with another) should be an equivalence relation
</li>
<li>
if two linear functions are tangent at <span class="math inline">\(x= a\)</span>, they are equal.
</li>
<li>
a quadratic has a horizontal tangent line at its vertex.
</li>
<li>
if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are tangent at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(a) = g(a)\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
if <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> is tangent to <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_1\)</span> is tangent to <span class="math inline">\(g_2\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(f_1 + g_1\)</span> is tangent to <span class="math inline">\(f_2 + g_2\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span> and similarly for the products.
</li>
<li>
the evident rule for composition.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Using these rules, we showed that if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a tangent line at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span>, it has only one. So we can define <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;(a)\)</span> to be the slope of the tangent line at <span class="math inline">\(x = a\)</span>, if it exists!
</p>
<p>The axioms are enough to prove the product rule, the sum rule and the chain rule. So we get derivatives of all polynomials, etc., assuming only that tangency can be defined.</p>
<p>
Then (limits having presented themselves in the computation of area) I defined <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be tangent to <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\lim_{x\to a} {f(x) - g(x) \over x-a} = 0\)</span>. We derive the limit formula for the derivative, and check the axioms.
</p>
<p>EDIT: Here’s some more detail, in case you’re wondering about implementing this yourself. I had the initial discussion about tangency in class, writing on the board. A day or so later, I handed out group projects in which the axioms were clearly stated and numbered, and the basic properties (as outlined above) given as problems.</p>
<p>The students’ initial impulse is to argue from common sense, but I insisted on argument directly from the axioms. There was one day that was kind of uncomfortable, because that is very unfamiliar thinking. I had them work in class several days, and eventually they really took to it.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 45)</h4>
<p>I’m going to answer this part:</p>
<blockquote>
does anyone out there actually use this definition to calculate a derivative that couldn’t be obtained by a known symbolic rule?
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. <span class="math inline">\(sin(x)\)</span>.</p>
<p>My point is that <em>of course</em> we can just learn the derivative of this function, but then we could just learn the derivative of any function. So looking for a “complicated function” that <em>needs</em> the limit definition is pointless: we could just extend our list of examples to include this function. It’s a bit like the complaint that there’s no closed form for a generic elliptic integral: all we really mean is that we haven’t given it a name yet.</p>
<p>In fact, one could do <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> like this, or even <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, but I think that <span class="math inline">\(sin(x)\)</span> has a good pedagogical value. If you can get them first to ponder the question, “What is <span class="math inline">\(sin(x)\)</span>?” then it might work. I’m teaching a course at the moment where I’m trying to get my students out of the “black box” mentality and start thinking about how one builds those black boxes in the first place. One of my starting points was “What is <span class="math inline">\(sin(x)\)</span>?”. Or more precisely, “What is <span class="math inline">\(sin(1)\)</span>?”. If you take that question, it can lead you to all sorts of interesting places: polynomial approximation of continuous functions, for example, and thence to Weierstrass’ approximation theorem.</p>
<p>Many students will just want the rules. But if the students refuse to learn, that’s their problem. My job is to provide them with an environment in which they can learn. Of course, I should ensure that what they are trying to learn is within their grasp, but they have to choose to grasp it. So I’m not going to give them a full exposition on the deep issues involving the ZF axioms if all I want is for them to have a vague idea of a “set” and a “function”, but I am going to ensure that what I say is true (or at the least is clearly flagged as a convenient lie).</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from Picasso (of all people) on teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
So how do you go about teaching them something new? By mixing what they know with what they don’t know. Then, when they see vaguely in their fog something they recognise, they think, “Ah, I know that.” And it’s just one more step to, “Ah, I know the whole thing.”. And their mind thrusts forward into the unknown and they begin to recognise what they didn’t know before and they increase their powers of understanding.
</blockquote>
<p>We all remember professors who forgot to mix the new in with the old and presented the new as completely new. We must also avoid the other extreme: that of not mixing in <em>any</em> new things and simply presenting the old with a new gloss of paint.</p>

<h3>35: Why is a topology made up of ‘open’ sets? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19152.html">64671</a> in 2016)</h3>
<section id="question-34" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I’m ashamed to admit it, but I don’t think I’ve ever been able to genuinely motivate the definition of a topological space in an undergraduate course. Clearly, the definition distills the essence of many examples, but it’s never been obvious to me how it came about, compared, for example, to the rather intuitive definition of a metric space. In some ways, the sparseness of the definition is startling as it tries to capture, apparently successfully, the barest notion of ‘space’ imaginable.</p>
<p>I can try to make this question more precise if necessary, but I’d prefer to leave it slightly vague, and hope that someone who has discussed this successfully in a first course, perhaps using a better understanding of history, might be able to help me out.</p>
<p>Added 24 March:</p>
<p>I’m grateful to everyone for their thoughtful answers so far. I’ll have to think over them a bit before I can get a sense of the ‘right’ answer for myself. In the meanwhile, I thought I’d emphasize again the obvious fact that the standard concise definition has been <em>tremendously successful.</em> For example, when you classify two-manifolds with it, you get equivalence classes that agree exactly with intuition. Then in as divergent a direction as the study of equations over finite fields, there is the etale topology*, which explains very clearly surprising and intricate patterns in the behaviour of solution sets.</p>
<p>*If someone objects that the etale topology goes beyond the usual definition, I would argue that the logical essence is the same. It is notable that the standard definition admits such a generalization so naturally, whereas some of the others do not. (At least not in any obvious way.)</p>
<p>For those who haven’t encountered one before, a <em>Grothendieck topology</em> just replaces subsets of a set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by maps <span class="math display">\[Y\rightarrow X.\]</span> The collection of maps that defines the topology on <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is required to satisfy some obvious axioms generalizing the usual ones.</p>
<p>Added 25 March:</p>
<p>I hope people aren’t too annoyed if I admit I don’t quite see a satisfactory answer yet. But thank you for all your efforts. Even though Sigfpe’s answer is undoubtedly interesting, invoking the notion of measurment, even a fuzzy one, just doesn’t seem to be the best approach. As Qiaochu has pointed out, a topological space is genuinely supposed to be more general than a metric space. If we leave aside the pedagogical issue for a moment and speak as working mathematicians, a general concept is most naturally justified in terms of its consequences. As pointed out earlier, topologies that have no trace of a metric interpretation have been consequential indeed.</p>
<p>When topologies were naturally generalized by Grothendieck, a good deal of emphasis was put on the notion of an <em>open covering</em>, and not just the open sets themselves. I wonder if this was true for Hausdorff as well. (Thanks for the historical information, Donu!) We can see the reason as we visualize a two-manifold. Any sufficiently fine open covering captures a combinatorial skeleton of the space by way of the intersections. Note that this is not true for a closed covering. In fact, I’m not sure what a sensible condition might be on a closed covering of a reasonable space that would allow us to compute homology with it. (Other than just saying they have to be the simplices of a triangulation. Which also reminds me to point out that homology can be computed for ordinary objects without any notion of topology.)</p>
<p>To summarize, a topology relates to <em>analysis</em> with its emphasis on functions and their continuity, and to <em>metric geometry</em>, with its measurements and distances. However, it also interpolates between these and something like <em>combinatorial geometry</em>, where continuous functions and measurements play very minor roles indeed.</p>
<p>For myself, I’m still confused.</p>
<p>Another afterthought: I see what I was trying to say above is that open sets in topology provide an abstract framework for describing local properties of functions. However, an open <em>cover</em> is also able to encode global properties of spaces. It seems the finite intersection property is important for this, but I’m not able to say for sure. And then, when I try to return to the pedagogical question with all this, I’m totally at a loss. There are very few basic concepts that trouble me as much in the classroom.</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-227" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 227)</h4>
<p>Topology is the art of reasoning about imprecise measurements, in a sense I’ll try to make precise.</p>
<p>In a perfect world you could imagine rulers that measure lengths exactly. If you wanted to prove that an object had a length of <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> you could grab your ruler marked <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, hold it up next to the object, and demonstrate that they are the same length.</p>
<p>In an imperfect world however you have rulers with tolerance. Associated to any ruler is a set <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> with the property that if your length <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> lies in <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>, the ruler can tell you it does. Call such a ruler <span class="math inline">\(R_U\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given two rulers <span class="math inline">\(R_U\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R_V\)</span> you can easily prove a length lies in <span class="math inline">\(U\cup V\)</span>. You just hold both rulers up to the length and the length is in <span class="math inline">\(U\cup V\)</span> if one or the other ruler shows a positive match. You can think of <span class="math inline">\(R_{U\cup V}\)</span> as being a kind of virtual ruler.</p>
<p>Similarly you can easily prove that a point lies in <span class="math inline">\(U\cap V\)</span> using two rulers.</p>
<p>If you have an infinite family of rulers, <span class="math inline">\(R_{U_i}\)</span>, then you can also prove that a length lies in <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_i U_i\)</span>. The length must lie in one of the <span class="math inline">\(U_i\)</span> and you simply exhibit the ruler <span class="math inline">\(R_{U_i}\)</span> matching for the appropriate <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>But you can’t always do the same for <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap_i U_i\)</span>. To do so might require an infinitely long proof showing that all of the <span class="math inline">\(R_{U_i}\)</span> match your length.</p>
<p>A topology is a (generalised) set of rulers that fits this description.</p>
<p>Your notion of ‘measurement’ in whatever problem you have might not match the notion that the above description tries to capture. But to the extent that it does, topology will work as a way to reason about your problem.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 187)</h4>
<p>The textbook presentation of a topology as a collection of open sets is primarily an artefact of the preference for minimalism in the standard foundations of the basic structures of mathematics. This minimalism is a good thing when it comes to <em>analysing</em> or <em>creating</em> such structures, but gets in the way of <em>motivating</em> the foundational definitions of such structures, and can also cause conceptual difficulties when trying to <em>generalise</em> these structures.</p>
<p>An analogy is with Riemannian geometry. The standard, minimalist definition of a Riemannian manifold is a manifold <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> together with a symmetric positive definite bilinear form <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> - the metric tensor. There are of course many other important foundational concepts in Riemannian geometry, such as length, angle, volume, distance, isometries, the Levi-Civita connection, and curvature - but it just so happens that they can all be described in terms of the metric tensor <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, so we omit the other concepts from the standard minimalist definition, viewing them as derived concepts instead. But from a conceptual point of view, it may be better to think of a Riemannian manifold as being an entire package of a half-dozen closely inter-related geometric structures, with the metric tensor merely being a canonical generating element of the package.</p>
<p>Similarly, a topology is really a package of several different structures: the notion of openness, the notion of closedness, the notion of neighbourhoods, the notion of convergence, the notion of continuity, the notion of a homeomorphism, the notion of a homotopy, and so forth. They are all important, and it is somewhat artificial to try to designate one of them as being more “fundamental” than the other. But the notion of openness happens to generate all the other notions, and has a particularly elegant and simple axiomatisation, so we have elected to make it the basis for the standard minimalist definition of a topology. But it is important to realise that this is by no means the only way to define a topology, and adopting a more package-oriented point of view can be preferable in some cases (for instance, when generalising the notion of a topology to more abstract structures, such as topoi, in which open sets no longer are the most convenient foundation to begin with).</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 130)</h4>
<p>It may seem hard to add a new answer to all this, but here’s mine. How to motivate the open set garbage of topological spaces:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Don’t.
</blockquote>
<p>There are many ideas in mathematics that can be easily derived from some real situation, and I would count approximation (ie limits), metric spaces, and neighbourhoods as among these. I think that it is quite easy to motivate the neighbourhood definition of topological spaces, for example, by considering real world examples of needing approximations that can’t be controlled by metrics (for example, if you always need your approximations to be greater than the true value).</p>
<p>But one can take this line too far and try to motivate everything in mathematics from real-world situations and this, I think, misses a great opportunity to teach something that all students of mathematics need to learn: that when something is presented to you in a particular way, you don’t have to accept that viewpoint but can choose a different one more suited to what you want to do.</p>
<p>We try to teach them this with bases of vector spaces: don’t use the basis given, use one that makes the matrix look nice (diagonal if possible!).</p>
<p>So here, we can present topological spaces as sets with lots of declared neighbouhoods satisfying certain simple, intuitive rules. But they are hard to work with so instead we work with open sets (sets which are neighbourhoods of all their points) <strong>because it makes life easier</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I should qualify the above a little. It’s written as a counterpoint to all the previous replies which try to justify open sets based on some intuition. I’m not saying that those are wrong - far from it - just that with something like this, one should think carefully about the message one is sending to the students about mathematics. At some point, they have to learn that mathematics strives to be clear and elegant rather than intuitive and vague, and it’s a good idea to do this with an example like topological spaces where we are still close to the intuition, rather than something like function spaces where intuition often takes a hike.</p>

</p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Update (2013):</b><br> This morning I received a letter from Ken Perko himself, revealing the true history of the Perko pair, which is so much more interesting! Perko writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
The duplicate knot in tables compiled by Tait-Little [3], Conway [1], and Rolfsen-Bailey-Roth [4], is not just a bookkeeping error. It is a counterexample to an 1899 “Theorem” of C.N. Little (Yale PhD, 1885), accepted as true by P.G. Tait [3], and incorporated by Dehn and Heegaard in their important survey article on “Analysis situs” in the German Encyclopedia of Mathematics [2].
</blockquote>
<p>Little’s `Theorem’ was that any two reduced diagrams of the same knot possess the same writhe (number of overcrossings minus number of undercrossings). The Perko pair have different writhes, and so Little’s “Theorem”, if true, would prove them to be distinct!</p>
<p>Perko continues:</p>
<blockquote>
Yet still, after 40 years, learned scholars do not speak of Little’s false theorem, describing instead its decapitated remnants as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tait_conjectures" rel="noreferrer">Tait Conjecture</a>- and indeed, one subsequently proved correct by Kauffman, Murasugi, and Thistlethwaite.
</blockquote>
<p>I had no idea! Perko concludes (boldface is my own):</p>
<blockquote>
<b>I think they are missing a valuable point. History instructs by reminding the reader not merely of past triumphs, but of terrible mistakes as well.</b>
</blockquote>
<p>And the final nail in the coffin is that <b>the image above isn’t of the Perko pair</b>!!! It’s the `Weisstein pair’ <span class="math inline">\(10_{161}\)</span> and mirror <span class="math inline">\(10_{163}\)</span>, described by Perko as “those magenta colored, almost matching non-twins that add beauty and confusion to the Perko Pair page of Wolfram Web’s Math World website. In a way, it’s an honor to have my name attached to such a well-crafted likeness of a couple of Bhuddist prayer wheels, but it certainly must be treated with the caution that its color suggests by anyone seriously interested in mathematics.”</p>
<p>The real Perko pair is this:</p>

<h3>39: Not especially famous, long-open problems which anyone can understand (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/100265.html">63721</a> in 2019)</h3>
<section id="question-38" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I’m asking for a big list of not especially famous, long open problems that anyone can understand. Community wiki, so one problem per answer, please.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> I plan to use this list in my teaching, to motivate general education undergraduates, and early year majors, suggesting to them an idea of what research mathematicians do.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of “not too famous”</strong> Examples of problems that are too famous might be the Goldbach conjecture, the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(3x+1\)</span></span>-problem, the twin-prime conjecture, or the chromatic number of the unit-distance graph on <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\({\Bbb R}^2\)</span></span>. Roughly, if there exists a whole monograph already dedicated to the problem (or narrow circle of problems), no need to mention it again here. I’m looking for problems that, with high probability, a mathematician working outside the particular area has never encountered.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of: anyone can understand</strong> The statement (in some appropriate, but reasonably terse formulation) shouldn’t involve concepts beyond high school (American K-12) mathematics. For example, if it weren’t already too famous, I would say that the conjecture that “finite projective planes have prime power order” does have barely acceptable articulations.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning of: long open</strong> The problem should occur in the literature or have a solid history as folklore. So I do not mean to call here for the invention of new problems or to collect everybody’s laundry list of private-research-impeding unproved elementary technical lemmas.

<section id="question-42" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Alright, so I have been taking a while to soak in as much advanced mathematics as an undergraduate as possible, taking courses in algebra, topology, complex analysis (a less rigorous undergraduate version of the usual graduate course at my university), analysis, model theory, and number theory. That is, I have taken enough ‘abstract’ (proof-based) mathematics courses to fall in love with the subject and decide to pursue it as a career.</p>
<p>However, I have been putting off taking a required ordinary differential equations course (colloquially referred to as ‘calc 4’, though this seems inappropriate) which will likely be very computational and designed to cater to the overpopulation of engineering students at my university.</p>
<p>So my question is, for someone who might have to actually concern themselves with the theory behind the ‘rules’ and theorems which will likely go unproven in this low-level course (likely of questionable mathematical content), what might be a decent supplementary text in ODE? That is, something substantive to counter-balance the ‘ODE for students of science and engineering’-type text I will have to wade through. I want to study algebraic geometry further (I have gone through Karen Smith’s text and the first part of Hartshorne), so something which goes from basic material through differential forms and related material would be nice.</p>
<p>
Thanks! (and yes, it’s embarrassing that I still haven’t taken the 200-level ODE course, but I have been putting it off in favor of more interesting/rigorous courses… but now there’s that whole graduation requirements issue). –Lambdafunctor

Don’t disparage the “rules” and computational aspects of differential equations.

<p><em>Firstly</em>, it is a beautiful subject with direct scientific origin and arguably most applications (save only calculus, perhaps) of all the courses you’d ever take. <em>Secondly</em>, these scientific connections continue to motivate and shape the development of the subject. <em>Thirdly</em>, rigor and abstraction are not substitutes for the actual mathematical content. Bourbaki never wrote a volume on differential equations, and the reason, I think, is that the subject is too content-rich to be amenable to axiomatic treatment. <em>Finally</em>, I’ve taught students who were gung-ho about rigorous real analysis, Rudin style, but couldn’t compute the Taylor expansion of <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{1+x^3}.\)</span> Knowing that the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence is an equivalence of triangulated categories may feel empowering, but as a matter of technique, it is mere stardust compared with the power of being able to compute the monodromy of a Fuchsian differential equation by hand.</p>
<p>Having forewarned you, here are my favorite introductory books on differential equations, all eminently suitable for self-study:</p>

<p>You’re in luck, lambda-since within the last few years,quite a few excellent advanced ODE texts have been published, in addition to the standard treatises. First, the more standard texts. If you want a strong theoretical course in ODE’s, you really need to decide how strong you want it. A full theoretical presentation requires functional analysis and graduate real variables. I don’t think you want anything <strong>that</strong> advanced,a t least not yet. So I’ll recommend some of the best “intermediate” level texts - they’re the most enjoyable to read, anyway.</p>
<p>My favorite is the beautiful geometric text <em>Ordinary Differential Equations</em> by Vladimir Arnold, in its’ third (and sadly final) edition. Not only does it contain a rigorous exposition of ODE’s and dynamical systems on manifolds, it contains a wealth of applications to physics,primarily classical mechanics. You’ll need a strong background in theoretical calculus and linear algebra to read this one. So worth it.</p>
<p>A book I found immensely helpful when learning this material was Lawrence Perko’s <em>Differemtial Equations and Dynamical Systems</em>. Not only does it cover more than Arnold’s book, particularly on dynamical systems and nonlinear ODE’s, it has a wealth of excellent exercises and diagrams of integral curves in a multitude of solution spaces/dynamical aystems,so important when learning the subject.</p>
<p>The old classic by Smale and Hirsch,<em>Differential Equations,Dynamical Systems and Linear Algebra</em> is best balanced by the second edition coauthored with Robert Devaney, <em>Differential Equations,Dynamical Systems and An Introduction To Chaos</em>. The second edition is more applied and less mathematically rigorous,but it contains much more information on nonlinear ODEs and chaotic dynamical systems. It also has many more pictures which are quite helpful in this subject-the sheer complexity of nonlinear systems really makes learning them nongeometrically strikingly noninformative. I would strongly advice getting BOTH books(the first edition is very pricey; I’d recommend borrowing it) and using thier union. Thier union may be the single best textbook that currently exists on the subject.</p>
<p>Lastly, there’s James D.Miess’ <em>Differential Dynamical Systems</em>, which contains not only a slightly more advanced presentation of the same material as Arnold and Perko, it contains many more applications and computer programming implementations,mainly to chemistry and classical mechanics.</p>
<p>All these books are outstanding and I think you’ll find what you’re looking for among them.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Is there a relationship between the eigenvalues of individual matrices and the eigenvalues of their sum? What about the special case when the matrices are Hermitian and positive definite?</p>
<p>I am investigating this with regard to finding the normalized graph cut under general convex constraints. Any pointers will be very helpful.</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-57" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 57)</h4>
<p>The problem of describing the possible eigenvalues of the sum of two hermitian matrices in terms of the spectra of the summands leads into deep waters. The most complete description was conjectured by Horn, and has now been proved by work of Knutson and Tao (and others?) - for a good discussion, see the <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200102/">Notices AMS article</a> by those two authors</p>
<p>Depending on what you want, there should be simpler results giving estimates on the eigenvalues of the sum. A book like Bhatia’s Matrix Analysis might have some helpful material.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2-score-38" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 38)</h4>
<p>
A simple estimate which is often useful is that, if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(a_1 &amp;gt; a_2 &amp;gt; \ldots &amp;gt; a_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_1 &amp;gt; b_2 &amp;gt; \ldots &amp;gt; b_n\)</span> and the eigenvalues of the sum are <span class="math inline">\(c_1 &amp;gt; c_2 &amp;gt; \ldots &amp;gt; c_n\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[
c_{i+j-1} \le a_i + b_j \quad\text{and}\quad c_{n-i-j} \ge a_{n-i} + b_{n-j}.
\]</span> The above conditions are necessary but not sufficient for <span class="math inline">\(A+B=C\)</span> to have a solution; see the Knutson-Tao article if you want sufficient conditions.
</p>
<p>If you do not impose that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are Hermitian then there are very few restrictions besides the trace being equal. More specifically, the <span class="math inline">\(3n\)</span>-tuples <span class="math inline">\((a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n, c_1, \ldots, c_n)\)</span> which occur as eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\((A,B,C)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(A+B=C\)</span> are dense in the hyperplane <span class="math inline">\(\sum a_i + \sum b_i = \sum c_i\)</span>.</p>

<section id="answer-3-score-13-1" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 13)</h4>
<p>If 2 positive matrices commute, than each eigenvalue of the sum is a sum of eigenvalues of the summands. This would be true more generally for commuting normal matrices. For arbitrary positive matrices, the largest eigenvalue of the sum will be less than or equal to the sum of the largest eigenvalues of the summands.</p>

<h3>45: What is the shortest Ph.D. thesis? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/54775.html">57495</a> in 2018)</h3>
<section id="question-44" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>The question is self-explanatory, but I want to make some remarks in order to prevent the responses from going off into undesirable directions.</p>
<p>It seems that every few years I hear someone ask this question; it seems to hold a perennial fascination for research mathematicians, just as quests for short proofs do. The trouble is that it has strong urban-legend tendencies: someone will say, “So-and-so’s thesis was only <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span></span> pages long!” where <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \ll 1\)</span></span>. It will often be very difficult to confirm or disconfirm such claims, since Ph.D. theses are often not even published, let alone readily available online. If you Google around for a while, as I did, you will find many dubious leads and can easily waste a lot of time on wild goose chases. Frankly, I’m a bit fed up with this state of affairs. I am therefore asking this question on MO in the hope that doing so will put this old question to rest, or at least establish provable upper bounds.</p>
<p>I would therefore request that you set yourself a high standard before replying. Don’t post a candidate unless you’re <i>sure</i> your facts are correct, and please give some indication why you’re so sure. Read the <a href="http://mathoverflow.tqft.net/discussion/946/shortest-phd-thesis/#Item_0" rel="nofollow noreferrer">meta discussion</a> before posting. (Note that the meta discussion illustrates that even a MathSciNet citation isn’t always totally definitive.) Include information about the content and circumstances of the thesis if you know it, but resist the temptation to gossip or speculate.</p>
<p>I’m not making this question <strike>community wiki or</strike> big-list because it should ideally have a definite answer, though I grant that it’s possible that there are some borderline cases out there (perhaps there are theses that were not written in scholarly good faith, or documents that some people would regard as equivalent to a Ph.D. thesis but that others would not, or theses in subjects that are strictly speaking distinct from mathematics but that are arguably indistinguishable from mathematics dissertations).</p>
<p>Finally, to anticipate a possible follow-up question, there is a list of short published papers <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/98/jour.rec" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> (search for “Nelson”). Note that the question of the shortest published paper is not as urban-legendy because the facts are easier to verify. I looked up the short papers listed there myself and found them to be quite interesting. So in addition to trying to settle an urban legend, I am hoping that this question will bring to light some interesting and lesser known mathematics.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a relatively gentle linear algebra text that integrates vector spaces and matrix algebra right from the start? I’ve found in the past that students react in very negative ways to the introduction of abstract vector spaces mid-way through a course. Sometimes it feels as though I’ve walked into class and said “Forget math. Let’s learn ancient Greek instead.” Sometimes the students realize that Greek is interesting too, but it can take a lot of convincing! Hence I would really like to let students know, right from the start, what they’re getting themselves into.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a text that might help me do this in a not-too-advanced manner? One possibility, I guess, is Linear Algebra Done Right by Axler, but are there others? Axler’s book might be too advanced.</p>

<p>For teaching the type of course that Dan described, I’d like to recommend David Lay’s “Linear algebra”. It is very thoroughly thought out and well written, with uniform difficulty level, some applications, and several possible routes/courses that he explains in the instructor’s edition. Vector spaces are introduced in Chapter 4, following the chapters on linear systems, matrices, and determinants. Due to built-in redundancy, you can get there earlier, but I don’t see any advantage to that.

<h4>Answer 2 (score 22)</h4>
<p>I rather like Linear Algebra Done Right, and depending on the type of students you are aiming the course for, I would recommend it over <strong>Hoffman and Kunze</strong>. Since you seemed worried that Axler might be too advanced, my feeling is that Hoffman and Kunze will definitely be (especially if these are students who have never been taught proof-based mathematics).</p>
<p>Of course, the big caveat here being that <strong>Axler</strong> avoids determinants at all costs, and this will put more on you to introduce them comprehensively.</p>
<p>I’ve never looked at it, but another one worth considering might be <strong>Halmos’s Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces</strong>.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 21)</h4>
<p>Hands-down, my favorite text is Hoffman and Kunze’s Linear Algebra. Chapter 1 is a review of matrices. From then on, everything is integrated. The abstract definition of a vector space is introduced in chapter 2 with a review of field theory. Chapter 3 is all about abstract linear transformations as well as the representation of such transformations as matrices. I’m not going to recount all of the chapters for you, but it seems to be exactly what you want. It’s also very flexible for teaching a course. It includes sections on modules and derives the determinant both classically and using the exterior algebra. Normed spaces and inner product spaces are introduced in the second half of the book, and do not depend on some of the more “algebraic” sections (like those mentioned above on modules, tensors, and the exterior algebra).</p>
<p>From what I’ve been told, H&amp;K has been the standard linear algebra text for the past 30 or so years, although universities have been phasing it out in recent years in favor of more “colorful” books with more emphasis on applications.</p>
<p>Edit: One last thing. I have not heard great things about Axler. While the book achieves its goals of avoiding bases and matrices for almost the entire book, I have heard that students who have taken a course modeled on Axler have a very hard time computing determinants and don’t gain a sufficient level of competence with explicit computations using bases, which are also important. Based on your question, it seems like Axler’s approach would have exactly the same problems you currently have, but going in the “opposite direction”, as it were.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>The history of proving numbers irrational is full of interesting stories, from the ancient proofs for <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2}\)</span>, to Lambert’s irrationality proof for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, to Roger Apéry’s surprise demonstration that <span class="math inline">\(\zeta(3)\)</span> is irrational in 1979.</p>
<p>There are many numbers that seem to be waiting in the wings to have their irrationality status resolved. Famous examples are <span class="math inline">\(\pi+e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(2^e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{\sqrt 2}\)</span>, and the Euler–Mascheroni constant <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>. Correct me if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t most mathematicians find it a great deal more surprising if any of these numbers turned out to be rational rather than irrational?</p>
<p>Are there examples of numbers that, while their status was unknown, were “assumed” to be irrational, but eventually shown to be rational?</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 152)</h4>
<p>Another ‘opposite’ example - a naturally occurring number suspected to be rational but turning out to be irrational - occurs in the study of random polytopes. In 1923, Blaschke asked</p>
<blockquote>
What is the expected volume of a tetrahedron with vertices chosen randomly in a unit volume tetrahedron ?
</blockquote>
<p>The corresponding answer for a unit line is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span> and for a unit triangle it’s <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{12}\)</span>. Klee made the (very plausible) conjecture that for the tetrahedron the answer is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{60}\)</span> but later Monte Carlo experiments suggested the answer was closer to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{57}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then in 2001, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TetrahedronTetrahedronPicking.html">Buchta and Reitzner</a> showed that the answer is actually</p>

Here is the proof of the equivalent statement “Every complex non-constant polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is surjective”.<br> 1) Let <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> be the finite set of critical points , i.e. <span class="math inline">\(p&#39;(z)=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(z\in C\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is finite by elementary algebra.
</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Remove <span class="math inline">\(p(C)\)</span> from the codomain and call the resulting open set <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and remove from the domain its inverse image <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1}\left( p (C) \right)\)</span>, and call the resulting open set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Note that the inverse image is again finite.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you get an open map from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, which is also closed, because any polynomial is proper (inverse images of compact sets are compact). But <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is connected and so <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is surjective.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I like this proof because you can try it for real polynomials and it breaks down at step 3) because if you remove a single point from the line you disconnect it, while you can remove a finite set from a plane leaving it connected.</p>

<section id="answer-2-score-95" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 95)</h4>
<p>Here is a standard algebraic proof. It suffices to show that if <span class="math inline">\(L/\mathbb{C}\)</span> is a finite extension, then <span class="math inline">\(L=\mathbb{C}\)</span>. By passing to a normal closure we assume that <span class="math inline">\(L/\mathbb{R}\)</span> is Galois with Galois group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> be the Sylow-2 subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M=L^H\)</span>.</p>
<p>By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, <span class="math inline">\(M/\mathbb{R}\)</span> has odd degree. Let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\in M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> be its minimal polynomial. Then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> has odd degree and by the Intermediate Value Theorem, a real root. As <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is irreducible, it must have degree one. Then <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M=\mathbb{R}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(G=H\)</span> is a 2-group. Then <span class="math inline">\(G_1:=Gal(L/\mathbb{C})\)</span> is a 2-group as well.</p>
<p>Assuming that <span class="math inline">\(G_1\)</span> is not trivial, there must exist a degree 2 subextension <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>. But every quadratic complex polynomial has a root (by the quadratic formula), so we have a contradiction.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-3-score-49" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 49)</h4>
<p>You can prove it using only basic facts about continuity/compactness and the same estimate which makes the winding number/fundamental group of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> proofs work: first check that if <span class="math inline">\(p(z)=z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + \ldots + a_0\)</span> is a polynomial then <span class="math inline">\(|p(z)|\)</span> tends to infinity as <span class="math inline">\(|z|\)</span> tends to infinity (this is the “leading term dominates” estimate for large <span class="math inline">\(|z|\)</span>). It follows easily that <span class="math inline">\(|p|\)</span> attains a minimum value, since outside a large disc centered at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> the value of <span class="math inline">\(|p|\)</span> is really big, and the disc is compact, so <span class="math inline">\(|p|\)</span> attains a minimum on it. We want this minimum value to be zero, so suppose for the sake of contradiction it isn’t, then we can change coordinates if necessary so that minimum is attained at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, and rescale <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> so the minimum is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then you just have to show that if <span class="math inline">\(p(z) = 1+b_kz^k + \ldots + b_n z^n\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(k \geq 1\)</span>) then you can make <span class="math inline">\(|p|\)</span> smaller than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for some nonzero <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. But this is just the same kind of estimate as before: the term <span class="math inline">\(b_kz^k\)</span> dominates the other terms for <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> small, and we can easily arrange for <span class="math inline">\(b_kz^k\)</span> to be a negative real giving the required contradiction.</p>
<p>The proof has the advantage that it makes the theorem “obvious” once you have some notion of compactness in the plane, so you could use this proof pretty early in a course that talks about functions on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R^n\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb C\)</span>. As I said before though, what makes the proof tick is the same as what makes the <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1(S^1)\)</span> proofs work, it just uses simpler techniques to get a contradiction. Unfortunately I have no idea who it’s due to (which is why I explained it rather than giving a reference…)</p>

<p>If random variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> has a probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> and random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has a probability distribution <span class="math inline">\(g(x)\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\((f*g)(x)\)</span>, the convolution of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, is the probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(X+Y\)</span>. This is the only intuition I have for what convolution means.</p>
<p>Are there any other intuitive models for the process of convolution?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-179" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 179)</h4>
<p>I remember as a graduate student that Ingrid Daubechies frequently referred to convolution by a bump function as “blurring” - its effect on images is similar to what a short-sighted person experiences when taking off his or her glasses (and, indeed, if one works through the geometric optics, convolution is not a bad first approximation for this effect). I found this to be very helpful, not just for understanding convolution per se, but as a lesson that one should try to use physical intuition to model mathematical concepts whenever one can.</p>
<p>More generally, if one thinks of functions as fuzzy versions of points, then convolution is the fuzzy version of addition (or sometimes multiplication, depending on the context). The probabilistic interpretation is one example of this (where the fuzz is a a probability distribution), but one can also have signed, complex-valued, or vector-valued fuzz, of course.</p>

What is the operator <span class="math inline">\(C_f\colon g\mapsto f*g\)</span>? Consider the translation operator <span class="math inline">\(T_y\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(T_y(g)(x)=g(x-y)\)</span>, and look at <span class="math inline">\(f*g(x)=\int_{\mathbb{R}}f(y)g(x-y) \, dy\)</span>.

</p>
<p>Tying this in with Terry Tao’s answer, which came in while I was writing the above, if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bump function, say nonnegative, with integral equal to 1 and concentrated near the origin, then <span class="math inline">\(f*g\)</span> is a (generalized) linear combination of translates of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, each one translated just a short distance, hence the blurryness of the result.</p>

<p>
I’m going to give two families of bounds, one for when <span class="math inline">\(k = N/2 + \alpha \sqrt{N}\)</span> and one for when <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is fixed.
</p>
<p>The sequence of binomial coefficients <span class="math inline">\({N \choose 0}, {N \choose 1}, \ldots, {N \choose N}\)</span> is symmetric. So you have</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=0}^{(N-1)/2} {N \choose i} = {2^N \over 2} = 2^{N-1}\)</span></p>
<p>
when <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is odd.<br> (When <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is even something similar is true but you have to correct for whether you include the term <span class="math inline">\({N \choose N/2}\)</span> or not.
</p>
<p>
Also, let <span class="math inline">\(f(N,k) = \sum_{i=0}^k {N \choose i}\)</span>.<br> Then you’ll have, for real constant <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>,
</p>
<p>$ _{N } {f(N,N/2+ ) 2^N} = g() $</p>
<p>for some function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>. This is essentially a rewriting of a special case of the central limit theorem. The Hamming weight of a word chosen uniformly at random is a sum of Bernoulli(1/2) random variables.</p>
<p>
For fixed <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N \to \infty\)</span>, note that <span class="math display">\[ {{N \choose k} + {N \choose k-1} + {N \choose k-2}+\dots   \over {N \choose k}} 
= {1 + {k \over N-k+1} + {k(k-1) \over (N-k+1)(N-k+2)} + \cdots} \]</span> and we can bound the right side from above by the geometric series <span class="math display">\[ {1 + {k \over N-k+1} + \left( {k \over N-k+1} \right)^2 + \cdots} \]</span> which equals <span class="math inline">\({N-(k-1) \over N - (2k-1)}\)</span>. Therefore we have <span class="math display">\[ f(N,k) \le {N \choose k} {N-(k-1) \over N-(2k-1)}.\]</span>

<h3>52: What are the most misleading alternate definitions in taught mathematics? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/7584.html">55284</a> in 2015)</h3>
<section id="question-51" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I suppose this question can be interpreted in two ways. It is often the case that two or more equivalent (but not necessarily semantically equivalent) definitions of the same idea/object are used in practice. Are there examples of equivalent definitions where one is more natural or intuitive? (I’m meaning so greatly more intuitive so as to not be subjective.)</p>
<p>Alternatively, what common examples are there in standard lecture courses where <em>a particular</em> symbolic definition obscures the concept being conveyed.</p>

<p>
Many topics in linear algebra suffer from the issue in the question. For example:
</p>
<p>
In linear algebra, one often sees the determinant of a matrix defined by some ungodly formula, often even with special diagrams and mnemonics given for how to compute it in the 3x3 case, say.
</p>
<p>det(A) = some horrible mess of a formula</p>
<p>
Even relatively sophisticated people will insist that det(A) is the sum over permutations, etc. with a sign for the parity, etc. Students trapped in this way of thinking do not understand the determinant.
</p>
<p>
The right definition is that det(A) is the volume of the image of the unit cube after applying the transformation determined by A. From this alone, everything follows. One sees immediately the importance of det(A)=0, the reason why elementary operations have the corresponding determinant, why diagonal and triangular matrices have their determinants.
</p>
<p>
Even matrix multiplication, if defined by the usual formula, seems arbitrary and even crazy, without some background understanding of why the definition is that way.
</p>
<p>
The larger point here is that although the question asked about having a single wrong definition, really the problem is that <b>a limiting perspective can infect one’s entire approach to a subject.</b> Theorems, questions, exercises, examples as well as definitions can be coming from an incorrect view of a subject!
</p>
<p>
Too often, (undergraduate) linear algebra is taught as a subject about static objects—matrices sitting there, having complicated formulas associated with them and complex procedures carried out with the, often for no immediately discernible reason. From this perspective, many matrix rules seem completely arbitrary.
</p>
<p>
The right way to teach and to understand linear algebra is as a fully dynamic subject. The purpose is to understand transformations of space. It is exciting! We want to stretch space, skew it, reflect it, rotate it around. How can we represent these transformations? If they are linear, then we are led to consider the action on unit basis vectors, so we are led naturally to matrices. Multiplying matrices should mean composing the transformations, and from this one derives the multiplication rules. All the usual topics in elementary linear algebra have deep connection with essentially geometric concepts connected with the corresponding transformations.

<p>Here’s another algebra peeve of mine. The definition of a normal subgroup in terms of conjugation is pretty strange until it’s explained that normal subgroups are the ones you can quotient by. Again, in my opinion I think normal subgroups should be introduced as kernels of homomorphisms from the get-go.</p>

<p>In my experience, introductory algebra courses never bother to clarify the difference between the direct sum and the direct product. They’re the same for a finite collection of abelian groups, which in my opinion gets confusing.</p>
<p>Of course, they’re quite different for infinite collections. I think students should be taught sooner rather than later that the first is the coproduct and the second is the product in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Ab}\)</span>. This clarifies the constructions for non-abelian groups as well, since the direct product remains a product in <span class="math inline">\(\text{Grp}\)</span> but the coproduct is very different!</p>

<h3>53: How Much Work Does it Take to be a Successful Mathematician? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/9799.html">54789</a> in 2009)</h3>
<section id="question-52" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>Famous anecdotes of G.H. Hardy relay that his work habits consisted of working no more than four hours a day in the morning and then reserving the rest of the day for cricket and tennis. Apparently his best ideas came to him when he wasn’t “doing work.” Poincare also said that he solved problems after working on them intensely, getting stuck and then letting his subconscious digest the problem. This is communicated in another anecdote where right as he stepped on a bus he had a profound insight in hyperbolic geometry.</p>
<p>I am less interested in hearing more of these anecdotes, but rather I am interested in what people consider an appropriate amount of time to spend on doing mathematics in a given day if one has career ambitions of eventually being a tenured mathematician at a university.</p>
<p>I imagine everyone has different work habits, but I’d like to hear them and in particular I’d like to hear how the number of hours per day spent doing mathematics changes during different times in a person’s career: undergrad, grad school, post doc and finally while climbing the faculty ladder. “Work” is meant to include working on problems, reading papers, math books, etcetera (I’ll leave the question of whether or not answering questions on MO counts as work to you). Also, since teaching is considered an integral part of most mathematicians’ careers, it might be good to track, but I am interested in primarily hours spent on learning the preliminaries for and directly doing research.</p>
<p>I ask this question in part because I have many colleagues and friends in computer science and physics, where pulling late nights or all-nighters is commonplace among grad students and even faculty. I wonder if the nature of mathematics is such that putting in such long hours is neither necessary nor sufficient for being “successful” or getting a post-doc/faculty job at a good university. In particular, does Malcom Gladwell’s 10,000 hour rule apply to mathematicians?</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

I agree that hard work and stubbornness are very important (I think we should all take after Wiles and Perelman as much as we can). But it is also important how you spend the many hours you dedicate to mathematics. For instance, choice of problems is quite important: it is important to make sure that when you work on something, you spend your time usefully, i.e. you not only make progress on this particular problem, but also learn something new about mathematics in general. It is also important not to get hyperfocused on a fruitless attempt to solve a problem; after some time and effort spent on it, it becomes addictive. In such a situation, it is sometimes better to stop and ask for help/read something or switch to another problem for a while. Often, you’ll wake up one morning a month or a year later and see that the insurmountable obstacle has magically disappeared! Or maybe this “Aha!” moment will come during a discussion with another mathematician, or while listening to a talk. For many people it is also helpful to have many simultaneous projects, so that when you get stuck on one, you can work on another. To summarize, I think that not only the number of hours matters, but also how efficiently you spend them, not only in terms of publishable results, but also in terms of your personal growth as a mathematician.

<h4>Answer 2 (score 72)</h4>
<p>Neglecting good sleep as a way of doing mathematics is not a good idea. To do mathematics, you need to get enough rest. As to the number of hours per day, it is impossible to count this. When you think about a mathematical problem, you think about it all the time, including when you are asleep. It is true that mathematicians who work more do tend to achieve more, and those with the very top achievements do tend to work really a lot. But no amount of hours spent per day sitting at the table guarantees anyone anything in mathematics. The key word is not “long hours”, but “dedication”.</p>

<section id="answer-3-score-37" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 37)</h4>
<p>Well, I can’t consider my self a successful mathematician, but from observing a few ones I know, here is my 2 cents:</p>
<p>
The 10,000 hour rule (this is of course pseudo-science) certainly apply almost by definition: most mathematician start training in college if not before. If you count up to postdoc, which is very typical, that is about 12 years, and an average of 3 hours/day give you 10,000 already.
</p>
<p>Certainly work habits vary, but it does seem that quite a few successful mathematicians I have met know how to enjoy life. Having said that, I think a blessing/curse of our profession is that the lab is in our mind. So it looks like we do not work that hard, compared to some other fields, since some of my friends in physics/biology have to stay at the lab at nights frequently because of experiments. On the other hand, math can follow you around even when you are playing tennis (I can confirm that from personal experience!).</p>

<h3>55: Undergraduate math research (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/45802.html">51577</a> in 2013)</h3>
<section id="question-54" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I believe this is the right place to ask this, so I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on research at the undergraduate level.</p>
<p>I was recently accepted into the <a href="http://www.unh.edu/mcnair/">McNair Scholars program</a>. It is a preparatory program for students who want to go on to graduate school. I am expected to submit a research topic proposal in the middle of the spring semester and study it during the summer with a mentor.</p>
<p>Since I am currently in the B.S. Mathematics program and I want to get my Masters later. I figured that while my topic can be in any area, it should be in math since it is my main interest as well.</p>
<p>I am a junior at the moment and taking: One-Dimensional Real Analysis, Intro to Numerical Methods, and Abstract Algebra. I frequently search MathWorld and Wikipedia for topics that interest me, although I don’t consider myself a brilliant student or particularly strong. I have begun speaking with professors about their research also.</p>
<p>I have not met any other students doing undergraduate math research and my current feeling is that many or all the problems in math are far beyond my ability to research them. This may seem a little defeatist but it seems mathematics is progressively becoming more specialized. I know that there are many areas emerging in Applied mathematics but they seem to be using much higher mathematics as well.</p>
<p>My current interest is Abstract Algebra and Game Theory and I have been considering if there are possibilities to apply the former to the latter.</p>
<p>
So my questions are: 1) Are my beliefs about the possibilities of undergraduate research unfounded? 2) Where can I find online math journals? 3) How can I go about finding what has been explored in areas of interest. Should I search through Wikipedia and MathWorld bibliographies and or look in the library for research?
</p>
<p>Thanks I hope someone can help to clarify and guide me.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 40)</h4>
<p>Since you are a student who’s already interested in going on to graduate school and is specifically asking about finding a topic to study at your undergraduate level program at McNair, please <em>disregard the negative nattering nabobs</em> whose answers and comments suggest that undergraduates have no place or business in trying to perform research, whether it’s research as defined for all scientists or the “research experience” that is put together for undergraduates and for advanced high-school students. Undergraduates can definitely perform research, or even benefit from going through a structured and well-administered “research experience”.</p>
<p>I agree with Peter Shor about finding a mentor, or multiple mentors, as soon as possible. There’s no reason you have to be limited to getting advice from just one professor or teacher.</p>
<p>I agree with Ben Webster, specifically about speaking with professors in order to get a reasonable idea about the level of work that would be needed for you to perform useful research at an undergraduate level. A few other suggestions come to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
if you are at an institution that offers Masters and Ph.D. level degrees in mathematics, then your institution’s library should have multiple <strong>research journals in hard-copy</strong>. I have found that it is much easier to go to the stacks in the library and browse through one or two year’s worth of Tables of Contents and Abstracts in one journal in an afternoon or evening. This will familiarize you with the types of research papers being published currently, and make you aware of what “quanta” of research is enough to be a single research article.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
make sure to attend Seminars, Colloquia, and (if your school’s graduate students have one) any graduate research seminar courses that you can find time for. This will allow you to become more familiar with various subtopics within the topics of your interests, and to see what the current areas of interest are for local and visiting faculty members.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Colloquia are great as they often start by including a brief history of the topic by an expert in that field.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Seminars are great because they allow students to see the social aspect of math, including the give-and-take and the critical comments and requests for more detail and explanation, even by tenured faculty who don’t follow a speaker’s thought processes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graduate student seminar presentations are great because a student observes how graduate students can falter during presentations, how they are quizzed/coached/criticized/mentored/assisted by faculty during their presentations.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I’ll admit that I’m not sure attending dissertation defenses would be of any serious benefit to the undergraduate student, other than observing the interaction level (animosity level?) between faculty and graduate students.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
absolutely make sure to schedule some time to meet with mathematics professors who specialize in the fields of your interest, and communicate your desire to do research while you are an undergraduate, and communicate your desire to go on to graduate studies in mathematics.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
look on the internet and search for undergraduate opportunities for research in mathematics. I guarantee you will find quite a number of web sites that can give you more information. MIT has an undergraduate research opportunity program that many of their students take advantage of. Your institution may have professors who can speak with you and give you advice.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, make sure to speak with more than one professor, and <strong>do not take any single person’s advice as being the final word.</strong> Mathematicians are human beings too, and subject to the foibles and inclinations and disinclinations that all human beings have. If you run into disgruntled and critical individuals, do not let that dissuade you from going on into mathematics or decrease your desires. If you run into overly optimistic individuals who praise you too much and are too eager to take you on to do “scut work” computer programming, thank them for their time and let them know you’ll come back to speak with them after you’ve spoken with other professors and weighed your options. Don’t turn anyone down immediately. Always be polite in speaking with professors and teachers. Ask them how they chose their topics for their degrees, and you’ll learn a lot.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate in the US with some research experience, let me offer my take on the situation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I think it’s important not to have a finished product (that is, a piece of original research) as the end goal. This past summer I did some research through MIT’s <a href="http://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/general/spur.html">SPUR</a> program, and this is their definition of success:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
Significant progress, relative to one’s own background and experience, in developing interests, satisfaction, skill, and ideas, rather than getting the complete solution to a problem.
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a really nice sentiment. The goal is not for you to start making serious contributions to mathematics but to prepare you in several ways for a graduate experience. (If you’re curious, I blogged a little about my research <a href="http://qchu.wordpress.com/2010/06/26/coxeter-groups/">here</a> and for several posts afterwards. I did not prove a new result, but I learned a lot and thought it was a valuable experience.)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>It depends on what your institution has subscriptions to. Click around on scholar.google.com to see what you can access without paying for. Many institutions, for example, have access to <a href="http://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> or <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/">SpringerLink</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find someone who knows the subject and ask them to mentor you. Or, find a mentor and ask them for a subject. This is hard to do without guidance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let me also give you some advice you didn’t ask for. If you are seriously planning on graduate studies, I think you should expand your mathematical worldview as much as possible beforehand. The easiest way to do that, in my opinion, is to <strong>read math blogs.</strong> I recommend starting with <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com">Terence Tao’s</a> and <a href="http://gowers.wordpress.com">Tim Gowers’</a> and working from there, and I also recommend John Baez’s <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html">This Week’s Finds</a> (actually, read the rest of his <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">stuff</a> too). Math blogs are a valuable source of insight into mathematics and how mathematicians work, and these three are particularly interesting and well-written. Terence Tao’s blog also contains his career advice, which is worth a read.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 26)</h4>
<p>So on the one hand I have a very strong cultural bias against undergraduate research programs. I don’t think trying to emphasize <em>originality</em> is a good idea. I think it would be much better to give people problems to work on that have already been solved and so you know lead to good and interesting mathematics. By forcing people to work on “new” questions I think you are often forcing them to work on bad math.</p>
<p>On the other hand, just because I think it would be better for people to do other sorts of programs, REU-style programs are what exist and they seem to work reasonably well for a lot of people. Furthermore, they’re certainly valuable as an alternative to classroom learning. Real math research is not like what happens at most REUs, but it’s also not like what happens in a classroom, so doing an REU is still going to help you get closer to understanding the scope of what a graduate student does.</p>
<p>So yes it’s certainly possible and somewhat valuable for undergraduates to try to do “research,” but you shouldn’t expect that research to be the same sort of research that mathematicians are really doing.</p>

<section id="question-55" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>This is probably too general a question to ask without some specific context, but I’m going to give it a shot anyway:</p>
<p><strong>What are the <em>practical</em> differences between using a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LorentzianFunction.html">Lorentzian function</a> and using a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GaussianFunction.html">Gaussian function</a> for the purposes of fitting?</strong></p>
<p>They obviously both have different mathematical formulas, but to my (untrained) eye they both seem to model similar curves, perhaps even curves that could be reached exactly by either function given the right inputs.</p>
<p>If we’re talking about fitting (which we are…), then presumably the person choosing between one or the other is interested in the values of the chosen function’s variables (or some other feature of the curve like its height or <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FullWidthatHalfMaximum.html">FWHM</a>), once the fitting has been done. <strong>Why?</strong> Presumably, the function is chosen since its mathematical formula instrinsicly relates to some part of the system that produced the data, but what has the Lorentzian got that the Gaussian doesn’t, or vice-versa? (Or any other curve, for that matter?)</p>
<p>Ok, I really do apologise - I know this is a poor (and poorly worded) question. Hopefully somebody understands what I’m trying to get at and can point me in the right direction.</p>

A Short answer: Robustness. The gaussian distribution effectively assumes there are no outliers. If that assumption is wrong, it can give misleading results! But, on the other hand, using the cauchy distribution might be too extreme.

<p>This depends on what you are trying to model. In my work (vibrational spectroscopy) the Lorentz lineshape is used to model ‘pure’ vibrational modes, which only undergo homogeneous line-broadening. The Gaussian lineshape is used to model those curves which have additional broadening terms from instrumental effects.</p>
<p>Here is a citation to a paper on this: Robert Meier, Vibrational Spectroscopy 39 (2005) 266–269</p>

<p>The Lorentzian function has more pronounced tails than a corresponding Gaussian function, and since this is the natural form of the solution to the differential equation describing a damped harmonic oscillator, I think it should be used in all physics concerned with such oscillations, i.e. natural line widths, plasmon oscillations etc.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>While playing around with Mathematica I noticed that most polynomials with real coefficients seem to have most complex zeroes very near the unit circle. For instance, if we plot all the roots of a polynomial of degree 300 with coefficients chosen randomly from the interval <span class="math inline">\([27, 42]\)</span>, we get something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wyg89.png" alt="roots"></p>
<p>The Mathematica code to produce the picture was:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>randomPoly[n_, x_, {a_, b_}] := 
  x^Range[0, n] . Table[RandomReal[{a, b}], {n + 1}];
Graphics[Point[{Re[x], Im[x]}] /. 
  NSolve[randomPoly[300, x, {27, 42}], x], Axes -&gt; True]</code></pre>
<p>If I try other intervals and other degrees, the picture is always mostly the same: almost all roots are close to the unit circle.</p>

<p>Let me give an informal explanation using what little I know about complex analysis.</p>

<p>
<span class="math display">\[\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}=\frac{d}{dz}\log(p(z))=\frac{d}{dz}\log(z-c_{1})+...+\log(z-c_{n})=

</p>
<p>Now assume that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a circle larger than the unit circle. Then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\oint_{\gamma}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz=\oint_{\gamma}\frac{na_{n}z^{n-1}+(n-1)a_{n-1}z^{n-2}+...+a_{1}}{a_{n}z^{n}+...+a_{0}}\approx\oint_{\gamma}\frac{n}{z}dz=2\pi in.\]</span></p>
<p>However, by the residue theorem,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\oint_{\gamma}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz=\oint_{\gamma}\frac{1}{z-c_{1}}+...+\frac{1}{z-c_{n}}dz=2\pi i|\{k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}|c_{k}\,\,\textrm{is within the contour}\,\,\gamma\}|.\]</span></p>
<p>
Combining these two evaluations of the integral, we conclude that <span class="math display">\[2\pi i n\approx 2\pi i|\{k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}|c_{k}\,\,\textrm{is within the contour}\,\,\gamma\}|.\]</span> Therefore there are approximately <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> zeros of <span class="math inline">\(p(z)\)</span> within <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, so most of the zeroes of <span class="math inline">\(p(z)\)</span> are within <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, so very few zeroes can have absolute value significantly greater than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. By a similar argument, very few zeroes can have absolute value significantly less than <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. We conclude that most zeroes lie near the unit circle.
</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Added Oct 11,2014}\)</span></p>
<p>
A modified argument can help explain why the zeroes tend to be uniformly distributed around the circle as well. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\theta\in[0,2\pi]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{\theta}\)</span> is the pizza slice shaped contour defined by <span class="math display">\[\gamma_{\theta}:=\gamma_{1,\theta}+\gamma_{2,\theta}+\gamma_{3,\theta}\]</span> where
</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma_{1,\theta}=([0,1+\epsilon]\times\{0\})\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma_{2,\theta}=\{re^{i\theta}|r\in[0,1+\epsilon]\}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma_{3,\theta}=\cup\{e^{ix}(1+\epsilon)|x\in[0,\theta]\}.\]</span></p>
<p>
Then <span class="math display">\[\oint_{\gamma_{\theta}}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz=
\oint_{\gamma_{\theta,1}}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz+\oint_{\gamma_{\theta,2}}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz+\oint_{\gamma_{\theta,3}}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz\]</span>
</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\approx O(1)+O(1)+\oint_{\gamma_{\theta,3}}\frac{p&#39;(z)}{p(z)}dz\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\approx O(1)+O(1)+\oint_{\gamma_{\theta,3}}\frac{na_{n}z^{n-1}+(n-1)a_{n-1}z^{n-2}+...+a_{1}}{a_{n}z^{n}+...+a_{0}}dz\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\approx O(1)+O(1)+\oint_{\gamma_{\theta,3}}\frac{n}{z}dz\approx n i\theta\]</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, there should be approximately <span class="math inline">\(\frac{i\theta}{2\pi}\)</span> zeroes inside the pizza slice <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_{\theta}\)</span>.</p>

<p>A complete derivation can be found in the classical paper of Shepp and Vanderbei:</p>

<p>But the heuristic explanation is that for small modulus the higher order terms contribute very little to the polynomials, and so can be thrown away (so the polynomial can be viewed as one of much lower degree, so has not so many roots), and for large modulus, one can use the same reasoning with <span class="math inline">\(z\rightarrow 1/z.\)</span></p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 51)</h4>
<p>I think the following geometric argument is interesting and maybe sufficient to answer “why” at an intuitive level (?).</p>
<p>When we take the powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the complex plane, the absolute value scales geometrically (<span class="math inline">\(|x^n| =|x|^n\)</span>) and the argument (angle with the x-axis) scales linearly (<span class="math inline">\(\arg x^n = n \arg x\)</span>). So the powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> look like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/w9cb8.jpg" alt="powers of x"></p>
<p>
If <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a root of our random polynomial <span class="math display">\[ p(x) = a_nx^n + \dots + a_1 x + a_0, \]</span> then each of these vectors (including the <span class="math inline">\(x^0\)</span> vector not drawn) is multiplied by a random coefficient, and the sum is equal to the zero vector. I’m just thinking of i.i.d. positive bounded coefficients for this response.
</p>
<p>The key point is that this weighted sum of the vectors in any particular direction must cancel out to zero if <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a root of the polynomial, yet each time <span class="math inline">\(x^k\)</span> goes “around the circle” the sizes <span class="math inline">\(|x^k|\)</span> of the vectors is geometrically larger — unless <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> is very close to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Intuitivley, some randomness in the coefficients will not be enough to cancel out large growth of <span class="math inline">\(|x^k|\)</span> because the vectors must sum to zero in every direction simultaneously.</p>
<p>
For concreteness, choose the direction of the positive <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis. Then the condition that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be a root implies that, letting <span class="math inline">\(\theta = \arg x\)</span> be the angle of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> with the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis, <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
  0 &amp;amp;= \sum_k a_k Re(x^k) \\
    &amp;amp;= \sum_k a_k |x|^k \cos (k \theta) .
\end{align*}\]</span> Heuristically, since <span class="math inline">\(\cos(k \theta)\)</span> is an oscillating term in <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(a_k\)</span> are independently random, <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> must be very close to one or else the large-<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> terms “unbalance” the sum. And this condition must hold in all directions, not just the positive <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis.
</p>
<p>I have drawn the case where <span class="math inline">\(|x| &amp;gt; 1\)</span>, but the <span class="math inline">\(|x| &amp;lt; 1\)</span> case is exactly the same.</p>
<p>(Edit: Maybe also interesting, in light of Francois’ simulations, but this suggests that if the coefficients are all positive, or more likely to be positive, and the degree <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is relatively small, then we should see few roots with argument (angle to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis) close to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>: In this case there is not enough oscillation to get cancellation. That is, the powers of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> don’t go “around the cycle” and neither are they cancelled by negative coefficients.)</p>

<h3>58: The “Dzhanibekov effect” - an exercise in mechanics or fiction? Explain mathematically a video from a space station (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/81960.html">49615</a> in 2011)</h3>
<section id="question-57" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>The question briefly:</p>
<p>Can one explain the “Dzhanibekov effect” (see youtube videos from space station or comments below) on the basis of the standard rigid body dynamics using Euler’s equations? (Or explain that this is impossible and that would be yet another focus … )</p>
<p>Here are more details.</p>
<p>See these curious videos from a space station:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2o9eBl_Gzw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2o9eBl_Gzw</a></p>
<p>
Or in the original form which is more striking (~30 seconds after the start): <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6Pt1O_gSE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL6Pt1O_gSE</a>
</p>
<p>
A mathematical description of the model is the standard rigid body motion in empty space (since we are in outer space), which (as is well-known) can be decomposed into a center of mass motion and a rotation part described by Euler’s equations. (Euler’s equations can be seen as a geodesic flow for some left-invariant metric on SO(3) - as V.I. Arnold taught.) Let us forget about the center of mass motion.
</p>
<p>The phenomena shown in the videos is the following - a rigid body is rotating around the axis and then SUDDENLY the rotation axis CHANGES ITS POSITION by 180 degrees. And this happens periodically with some time period.</p>
<p>I am a little puzzled how to explain this.</p>
<p>If we admit that the motion of this rigid body is EXACTLY the rotation around the axis this is for sure IMPOSSIBLE - Euler’s equations predict that such a motion will continue forever. However in the real world there is nothing exact so it might be related to some instability effect - that we are around an unstable equilibrium - and go away from it after some time…</p>
<p>Can it be so?</p>
<p>If it so, it is however not clear why it happens so quickly and we get exactly the rotation axis changing its position by 180 degrees…</p>
<hr>
<p>
Vladimir Dzhanibekov who observed this in 1985 is a famous Russian cosmonaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dzhanibekov">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Dzhanibekov</a> He was in space 5 times (as far as I know he is the champion in this). In 1985 his “mission impossible” was saving the Soviet space station “Salut-7” which due to some problems had run out of control…
</p>
<hr>
<p>
If this can be explained I think it can be a beautiful illustration for students in lectures on rigid body mechanics… Also if one would want to add some humor in such a lecture one may add that our Earth is this kind of finger nut so it might also do such things … (Maybe it really can?)

<h4>Answer accepted (score 118)</h4>
<p>One can see this effect qualitatively from Newtonian first principles such as <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(F=ma\)</span></span> (as opposed to Hamiltonian or Lagrangian principles, such as conservation of energy and angular momentum) by looking at a degenerate case, when one moment of inertia is very small and the other two are very close to each other.</p>
<p>More specifically, consider a thin rigid unit disk, initially oriented in the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(xy\)</span></span> plane and centred at the origin <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((0,0,0)\)</span></span>. We make the “spherical cow” hypotheses that this disk has infinitesimal thickness and mass, but infinite rigidity. On this disk, we place heavy point masses of equal mass <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span> at the points <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((1,0,0)\)</span></span> and <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((-1,0,0)\)</span></span> on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span> axis, and light point masses of equal mass <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span> at the points <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((0,1,0)\)</span></span> and <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((0,-1,0)\)</span></span> on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span> axis. Here <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(0 &amp;lt; m \ll M\)</span></span>, i.e. <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span> should be viewed as negligible with respect to <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>. (The moments of inertia are then <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(2m, 2M, 2(m+M)\)</span></span>, though we will not explicitly use these moments in the analysis below.)</p>
<p>We now set up the unstable equilibrium by rotating the disk around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span> axis. Thus, the light <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses stay fixed on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis, while the heavy <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses rotate in the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(xz\)</span></span>-plane. This is in equilibrium: there are no net forces on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses, while the rigid disk exerts a centripetal force on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses that keeps them moving in a circular motion on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(xz\)</span></span>-plane.</p>
<p>We can view this equilibrium in rotating coordinates, matching the motion of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses. (Imagine a camera viewing the disk, rotating around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis at exactly the same rate as the disk is rotating.) In this rotating frame, the disk is now stationary (so the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses are stuck on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis at <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((0,\pm 1,0)\)</span></span> and the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses are stuck on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis at <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((\pm 1,0,0)\)</span></span>), but there is a centrifugal force exerted on all bodies proportional to the distance to the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis. The <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses are on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis and thus experience no centrifugal force; but the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses are away from the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis and thus experience a centrifugal force, which is then balanced out by the centripetal forces of the rigid disk.</p>
<p>Now let us perturb the disk a bit, so that the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses and <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses are knocked a little bit out of position (but keeping the centre of mass fixed at <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((0,0,0)\)</span></span>). In particular, the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses are knocked away from the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis and now experience a little bit of centrifugal force. On the other hand, the rigid disk forces the light <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses to remain orthogonal to the heavy <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses, by exerting tension forces between the masses. In the regime where <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span> is negligible compared to <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>, these tension forces will barely budge the heavy <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span> masses (which therefore remain essentially fixed at <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\((\pm 1,0,0)\)</span></span> in the rotating frame), so the effect of these tension forces is to constrain the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses to lie in the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(yz\)</span></span>-plane (up to negligible errors which we now ignore). Rigidity also keeps the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses at a unit distance from the origin, and antipodal to each other, so the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses are now constrained to be antipodal points on the unit circle in the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(yz\)</span></span>-plane. However, other than this, rigidity imposes no further constraints on the location of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses, which can then move freely as antipodal points in this unit circle.</p>
<p>The effect of centrifugal force in the rotating frame is now clear: if an <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-mass (and its antipode) is perturbed to be a little bit off the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis in this unit circle with no initial velocity, then centrifugal force will nudge it a little further off the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis, slowly at first but with inexorable acceleration. Eventually it will shoot across the unit circle and then approach the antipode of its previous position. At this point the centrifugal forces act to slow the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses down, reversing all the previous acceleration, until one ends up with no velocity at a small distance from the antipode. The process then repeats itself (imagine a marble rolling frictionlessly between two equally tall hills, starting from a position very close to the peak of one of the hills).</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE, September 2019</strong>: Due to renewed interest in this question, I will expand upon my 2014 comment regarding why the above analysis appears at first glance to also lead to the incorrect conclusion that the disk rotation is also unstable if it one instead rotates around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis (so that it is now the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses that are stationary and the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses that are rotating), or equivalently if one swaps the location of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses and <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses (which we will not do here to try to reduce confusion).</p>
<p>The reason for this is that centrifugal force <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(F_{\mathrm{Cent}} = -m \Omega \times \Omega \times r\)</span></span> is only one of <em>two</em> inertial forces that are introduced when one is in a steadily rotating frame. The other inertial force introduced is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force" rel="noreferrer">Coriolis force</a> <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(F_{\mathrm{Cor}} = -2 m \Omega \times v\)</span></span>, which acts on moving bodies in the rotating reference frame in a direction orthogonal to the motion (and to the axis of rotation). Strictly speaking, one has to take into account the effect of <em>both</em> inertial forces when performing Newtonian mechanics in a steadily rotating frame. As it turns out, the Coriolis force has a negligible impact on the dynamics when rotating around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis, but dominates the dynamics when rotating around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis, which is why the preceding discussion is accurate in the former case but not the latter.</p>
<p>In more detail: suppose we are rotating around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis as in the above discussion. In the rotating frame of reference, and starting with a configuration slightly out of equilibrium, we have as before that the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses experience a little bit of centrifugal force and begin to slide away from the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis and into the rest of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(yz\)</span></span>-plane. When doing so, they will then experience some Coriolis force in a direction parallel to the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis (which direction it is depends on the orientation of the rotation, as per the right hand rule formula for the cross product). However, due to the rigidity of the disk, as mediated by tension forces within the disk, it is not possible for the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses to actually move in the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-direction without also moving the much heavier <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses. But the magnitude of the Coriolis force is proportional to the small mass <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span> rather than the large mass <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>, so by Newton’s law <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(F=Ma\)</span></span> for the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses, the Coriolis force (or more precisely, the tension force produced in response to the Coriolis force) actually barely affects the motion of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses, which basically stay put on the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis, and the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses therefore remain essentially constrained to the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(yz\)</span></span>-plane and cannot actually experience any significant motion in the direction of the Coriolis force. (This is what the sentence in the original explanation regarding how tension forces “barely budge” the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses was referring too, albeit somewhat obliquely.) The analysis of the original explanation now proceeds as before.</p>
<p>In contrast, suppose that the disk is close to the stable equilibrium state when it rotates around the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis. Working in a rotating frame around this axis, the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses are near the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis of rotation, while the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses lie near the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></span>-axis. As before, the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses experience centrifugal force and thus begin drifting slightly away from the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis into the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(xz\)</span></span>-plane. But then the Coriolis force on these masses kicks in, which is now proportional to the heavy mass <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span> rather than the light mass <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>. As such, the rigid tension forces connecting the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-masses to the much lighter <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(m\)</span></span>-masses offer very little resistance to the Coriolis force, and the motion of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-mass begins to rotate out of the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(xz\)</span></span>-plane, constantly experiencing Coriolis acceleration in a direction orthogonal to its motion. This effect tends to make the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span></span>-mass rotate in a tight circle, and basically neutralises the net effect of the centrifugal force by rotating any outward motion away from the <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span></span>-axis back into inward motion. The end result is that in the rotating frame, the disk wobbles a bit around its equilibrium state, but does not dramatically depart from it, which is what one would expect from a stable equilbrium (imagine now a marble rolling frictionlessly around the trough of a valley).</p>

<p>In English-speaking physics classes, this is usually called the “Tennis Racket Theorem”, because a tennis racket is a good example of a physical object with three widely separated moments of inertia. If you look in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dqCQqI-Gis" rel="noreferrer">this video</a>, you can see the 180 degree flip you describe taking place here on Earth. The interesting difference between Earth and space is that, on Earth, it is difficult to watch an object in free-fall for more than a second, so you only see a fraction of the orbits described in Marcos and Victor’s answers; the video I link to looks like about half an orbit. In space, you can see the cycle happen several times.</p>
<p>There are tons of proofs of the tennis racket theorem online, <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic455971.files/l21.pdf" rel="noreferrer">here</a> is one.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 17)</h4>
<p>Take a look at “Rigid Body Stability Theorem” in chapter 15 of Marsden and Ratiu’s “Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry”, which basically states that in situations like the one in the video (where, judging by the shape of the rotating object, the principal moments of inertia are mutually distinct), rotation about the middle principal axis is unstable. While the angular momentum of the rigid body is constant in its spatial representation, it is nonconstant with respect to the body’s frame. There is a figure following the aforementioned theorem which shows the flow lines for the angular momentum with respect to the body’s frame. There are three pairs of antipodal fixed points corresponding to rotation exactly about the principal axes. The “long” and “short” axes’ critical points are stable (in the sense of Liapunov), while the “middle” critical points are saddle points, and therefore unstable. Furthermore, there are flow lines coming arbitrarily close to both of the antipodal “middle” critical points. I believe the solutions associated with these flow lines are what you seek.</p>

<h3>59: Why is the gradient normal? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1977.html">48790</a> in 2017)</h3>
<section id="question-58" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>This is a somewhat long discussion so please bear with me. There is a theorem that I have always been curious about from an intuitive standpoint and that has been glossed over in most textbooks I have read. Quoting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set#Level_sets_versus_the_gradient" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, the theorem is:</p>
<blockquote>
The gradient of a function at a point is perpendicular to the level set of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at that point.
</blockquote>
<p>I understand the Wikipedia article’s proof, which is the standard way of looking at things, but I see the proof as somewhat magical. It gives a symbolic reason for why the theorem is true without giving much geometric intuition.</p>
<p>The gradient gives the direction of largest increase so it sort of makes sense that a curve that is perpendicular would be constant. Alas, this seems to be backwards reasoning. Having already noticed that the gradient is the direction of greatest increase, we can deduce that going in a direction perpendicular to it would be the slowest increase. But we can’t really reason that this slowest increase is zero nor can we argue that going in a direction perpendicular to a constant direction would give us a direction of greatest increase.</p>
<p>I would also appreciate some connection of this intuition to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multipliers" rel="noreferrer">Lagrange multipliers</a> which is another somewhat magical theorem for me. I understand it because the algebra works out but what’s going on geometrically?</p>
<p>Finally, what does this say intuitively about the generalization where we are looking to: maximize <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g(x,y) &amp;gt; c\)</span>.</p>
<p>I have always struggled to find the correct internal model that would encapsulate these ideas.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 83)</h4>
<p>The gradient of a function is normal to the level sets because it is <strong>defined</strong> that way. The gradient of a function is <strong>not</strong> the natural derivative. When you have a function, f, defined on some Euclidean space (more generally, a Riemannian manifold) then its derivative at a point, say x, is a function d<sub>x</sub>f on tangent vectors. The intuitive way to think of it is that d<sub>x</sub>f(v) answers the question:</p>
<blockquote>
If I move infinitesimally in the direction v, what happens to f?
</blockquote>
<p>So d<sub>x</sub>f is not itself a tangent vector. However, as we have an inner product lying around, we can convert it into a tangent vector which we call ∇f. This represents the question:</p>
<blockquote>
What tangent vector u at x best represents d<sub>x</sub>f?
</blockquote>
<p>What we mean by “best represents” is that u should satisfy the condition:</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;u,v&gt; = d<sub>x</sub>f(v) for all tangent vectors v
</blockquote>
<p>Now we look at the level set of f through x. If v is a tangent vector at x which is tangent to the level set then d<sub>x</sub>f(v) = 0 since f doesn’t change if we go (infinitesimally) in the direction of v. Hence our vector ∇f (aka u in the question) must satisfy &lt;∇f, v&gt; = 0. That is, ∇f is normal to the set of tangent vectors at x which are tangent to the level set.</p>
<p>For a generic x and a generic f (i.e. most of the time), the set of tangent vectors at x which are tangent to the level set of f at x is codimension 1 so this specifies ∇f up to a scalar multiple. The scalar multiple can be found by looking at a tangent vector v such that f does change in the v-direction. If no such v exists, then ∇f = 0, of course.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 23)</h4>
<p>If you are standing on a level set and want to walk some small distance d and get as far as possible from the level set, you want to walk along the normal. Otherwise, if the path you take has a tangent component, it will tend to keep you closer to the level set if d is small enough compared to the size of the level set. Furthermore, getting as far as possible from your level set is approximately the same as walking to the highest/lowest level curve in range, with the approximation improving as d shrinks.</p>

<h3>60: Periods and commas in mathematical writing (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/6675.html">48739</a> in 2009)</h3>
<section id="question-59" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I just realized that I am a barbarian when it comes to writing. But I am not entirely sure, so this might be the right place to ask. When typing display-mode formulae do you guys add a period after the formula ends a sentence?</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is the formula for a circle <span class="math display">\[x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\]</span><br> Therefore blabla…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
This is the formula for a circle <span class="math display">\[x^2 + y^2 = r^2\]</span><br> Therefore blabla…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My supervisor has been complaining a lot that I don’t use period and commas in my display-mode formulae. But I get uneasy doing that because it doesn’t feel natural to me, I took a look at two books at random and both of them so far do the punctuation in their display formulae.. I know this is stupid of me and its amazing I have never noticed that.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This would be a fantastic opportunity to see what people <em>actually</em> like as opposed to what they think they like. Everyone who has an opinion on what the punctuation should be should provide an illustrative example of such so that by the voting it can be seen what is actually preferred. If you do this, make your answer just the example (so provide any general homilies in another answer) so that the voting truly reflects the community view of the example.</p>

<p>from Michèle Audin’s <em>Conseils aux auteurs de textes mathématiques</em>, which you can get from her webpage.</p>
<p>A corollary is that when one writes a mathematical text one is writing <em>sentences</em>, to which all rules which apply to sentences of course apply. And, say, sentences end in a period.</p>

<section id="answer-2-score-75" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 75)</h4>
<p>This is something I’ve never paid attention to until graduate school, but virtually every book uses the convention that formulae in display mode are part of the text. Every Springer text for instance uses these conventions.</p>
<p>If we define the function <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\)</span> by</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[
f(x) = e^x,
\]</span>
</p>
<p>then we can place a comma after the definition to indicate a pause one might take if speaking such a sentence. We could also have defined the function by</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[
f(x) = \sin(x).
\]</span>
</p>
<p>As this last definition was the end of a sentence, it ought to have a period. Finally we could also have</p>
<p>
<span class="math display">\[
|f(x) - f(x_0)| &amp;lt; \varepsilon
\]</span>
</p>
<p>whenever <span class="math inline">\(|x - x_0| &amp;lt; \delta\)</span>. Here, no punctuation was needed.</p>
<p>There are exceptions: Spanier’s Algebraic Topology doesn’t follow these conventions, but Hardy does, and all modern books that I’ve read do. Unless I pay attention, I don’t even notice the punctuation.</p>

<h3>61: Where does a math person go to learn quantum mechanics? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/2917.html">48197</a> in 2016)</h3>
<section id="question-60" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>My undergraduate advisor said something very interesting to me the other day; it was something like “not knowing quantum mechanics is like never having heard a symphony.” I’ve been meaning to learn quantum for some time now, and after seeing it come up repeatedly in mathematical contexts like Scott Aaronson’s blog or John Baez’s TWF, I figure I might as well do it now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my physics background is a little lacking. I know some mechanics and some E&amp;M, but I can’t say I’ve mastered either (for example, I don’t know either the Hamiltonian or the Lagrangian formulations of mechanics). I also have a relatively poor background in differential equations and multivariate calculus. However, I do know a little representation theory and a little functional analysis, and I like q-analogues! (This last comment is somewhat tongue-in-cheek.)</p>
<p>Given this state of affairs, what’s my best option for learning quantum? Can you recommend me a good reference that downplays the historical progression and emphasizes the mathematics? Is it necessary that I understand what a Hamiltonian is first?</p>
<p>(I hope this is “of interest to mathematicians.” Certainly the word “quantum” gets thrown around enough in mathematics papers that I would think it is.)</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 49)</h4>
<p>It could be just my own personal bias, but I think it is difficult to learn quantum mechanics without first learning classical mechanics. I recommend taking a 1 semester course, either graduate or advanced undergraduate, in classical mechanics and then taking a quantum mechanics course. I also think it would be a mistake to start with an overly mathematically-oriented QM course. You want to learn how physicists think and how they use this stuff to come up with real physical predictions. Otherwise, you’re just learning math packaged as “physics”. You shouldn’t have much trouble later figuring out how to translate the physics back into math. But if you focus too much on the math at the beginning, you make it less likely you’ll ever understand the physics.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I have uniform value in [0,1). I’d like to transform it into a standard normal distribution value, in a deterministic fashion.</p>
<p>What I’m confused about with the Box-Muller transform is that it takes two uniform values in [0, 1), and transform them into two normal random values.</p>
<p>However, I only have one uniform value. How do I apply Box-Muller over a single value?</p>

<p>The Box-Muller method is commonly used. It’s simple to implement. And if you need several values, you can use it to produce normal samples two at a time. Otherwise, you could just discard one of the values and pretend you never created it.</p>
<p>George Marsaglia’s <a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v05/i08/paper">Ziggurat method</a> is more efficient than Box-Muller but more complicated.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Since the old days, many mathematicians have been attaching monetary rewards to problems they admit are difficult. Their reasons could be to draw other mathematicians’ attention, to express their belief in the magnitude of the difficulty of the problem, to challenge others, “to elevate in the consciousness of the general public the fact that in mathematics, the frontier is still open and abounds in important unsolved problems.<a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems" rel="noreferrer">1</a>”, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What others are there? To put some order into the answers, let’s put a threshold prize money of 100 USD. I expect there are more mathematicians who have tucked problems in their web-pages with some prizes.</p>
<p>What this question does not intend to achieve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
once offered but then collected or withdrawn offers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
new pledges of sums of money just here
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Some may be interested in the psychological aspects of money rewards. However, to keep the question focused, I hope this topic won’t be ignited here. One more, I understand that mathematicians do not work merely for money.</p>

<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> When computing the zeta function of a genus <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> curve over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_q\)</span>, the numerator is essentially of the form <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. (More precisely, it is of the form <span class="math inline">\(q^d f(t/\sqrt{q})\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of this form.)

<p>Consider the following probabilistic model: We choose an infinite string, call it <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>, of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>’s, <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>’s, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>’s and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>’s. Each letter of the string is chosen independently at random, with probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_C\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_G\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_T\)</span>.</p>
<p>Next, we copy the string <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> to form a new string <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}_1\)</span>. In the copying process, for each pair <span class="math inline">\((X, Y)\)</span> of symbols in <span class="math inline">\(\{ A, C, G, T \}\)</span>, there is some probability <span class="math inline">\(p_1(X \to Y)\)</span> that we will miscopy an <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. (The <span class="math inline">\(16\)</span> probabilities stay constant for the entire copying procedure.)</p>
<p>We repeat the procedure to form two more strings <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{D}_3\)</span>, using new probability matrices <span class="math inline">\(p_2(X \to Y)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_3(X \to Y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We then forget the ancestral string <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> and measure the <span class="math inline">\(64\)</span> frequencies with which the various possible joint distributions of <span class="math inline">\(\{ A, C, G, T \}\)</span> occur in the descendant strings <span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{D}_1, \mathcal{D}_2, \mathcal{D}_3)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our procedure depended on <span class="math inline">\(4+3 \times 16\)</span> inputs: the <span class="math inline">\((p_A, p_C, p_G, p_T)\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(p_i(X \to Y)\)</span>. When you remember that probabilities should add up to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, there are actually only <span class="math inline">\(39\)</span> independent parameters here, and we are getting <span class="math inline">\(63\)</span> measurements (one less than <span class="math inline">\(64\)</span> because probabilities add up to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>). So the set of possible outputs is a semialgeraic set of codimension <span class="math inline">\(24\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture:</strong> <a href="http://www.dms.uaf.edu/~eallman/">Elizabeth Allman</a> has a conjectured list of generators for the Zariski closure of the set of possible measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation:</strong> Obviously, this is a model of evolution, and one which (some) biologists actually use. Allman and Rhodes have shown that, if you know generators for the ideal for this particular case, then they can tell you generators for every possible evolutionary history. (More descendants, known sequence of branching, etc.) There are techniques in statistics where knowing this Zariski closure would be helpful progress.</p>

<h3>64: How large is TREE(3)? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/93828.html">46981</a> in 2015)</h3>
<section id="question-63" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Friedman, in <a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~friedman.8/pdf/EnormousInt112201.pdf" rel="noreferrer">http://www.math.osu.edu/~friedman.8/pdf/EnormousInt112201.pdf</a>, shows that TREE(3) is much larger than n(4), itself bounded below by <span class="math inline">\(A^{A(187195)}(3)\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the Ackerman function and exponentiation denotes iteration). But actually, using the fast-growing hierarchy, <span class="math inline">\(n(p)\)</span> is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(f_{\omega^{\omega^\omega}}(p)\)</span> (shown by Friedman in <a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~friedman.8/pdf/finiteseq10_8_98.pdf" rel="noreferrer">http://www.math.osu.edu/~friedman.8/pdf/finiteseq10_8_98.pdf</a>), while it seems that TREE grows faster than <span class="math inline">\(f_{\Gamma_0}\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\({\Gamma_0}\)</span> being the Feferman-Schütte ordinal). So it could well be that in fact TREE(3) is larger than, say, n(n(4)), or even any number expressible by iterations of n. What is known on this question?</p>
<p>For reference, I should have added that TREE(3) is the incredibly (at first, or even second look) large answer to the question : “which is the length of the longest sequence <span class="math inline">\((T_2,T_3,T_4,\dots,T_n)\)</span> of labeled trees such that <span class="math inline">\(T_k\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> nodes labeled <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> is not a subtree of <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i &amp;lt; j\)</span> ?”.</p>
<p>Here, trees are <i>rooted</i> trees, and are treated as poset on their sets of vertices. A tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is called a subtree of <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\)</span> if there is an inf-preserving embedding from <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(T&#39;\)</span>, (that is, an injective map <span class="math inline">\(h:Vertices(T) \to Vertices(T&#39;)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(h(\inf(x,y)) = \inf((h(x), h(y))\)</span>) that respects the labeling by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 22)</h4>
<p>I believe I can state with some confidence that TREE(3) is larger than <span class="math inline">\(f_{\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)} (n(4))\)</span>, given a natural definition of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> up to <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)\)</span>. I can state with certainty that TREE(3) is larger than <span class="math inline">\(H_{\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)} (n(4))\)</span>, where H is a certain version of the Hardy hierarchy.</p>
<p>To obtain this result, I will first define a version of TREE(n) for unlabeled trees:</p>
<p>Let tree(n) be the length of the longest sequence of unlabeled rooted trees <span class="math inline">\(T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_m\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> has less than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(n+i\)</span> vertices and for no <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i &amp;lt; j\)</span> do we have <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> homeomorphically embeddable into <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span>. (Note the term “embeddable” rather than “subtree”; the terms are different, and I believe using “subtree” would lead to infinite sequences.)</p>
<p>In order to obtain a long sequence of trees, we will define a well-order on unlabeled rooted trees. This definition will be by induction on the sum of the heights of the two trees being compared.</p>
<p>Define an immediate subtree of a rooted tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> to be a full subtree starting at one of its children.</p>
<p>Given two rooted trees <span class="math inline">\(S, T\)</span>, we define <span class="math inline">\(S = T\)</span> if the two trees are identical. We define <span class="math inline">\(S \leq T\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(S = T\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(S &amp;lt; T\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given two rooted trees <span class="math inline">\(S, T\)</span>, we define $ &lt; $ as follows. Say <span class="math inline">\(S &amp;lt; T\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(S \leq T_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> is an immediate subtree of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. Similarly, say <span class="math inline">\(T &amp;lt; S\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(T \leq S_i\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> is an immediate subtree of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, compare the number of children of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has more children than <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S &amp;gt; T\)</span>, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Otherwise, suppose <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> both have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> children. Let <span class="math inline">\(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_1, T_2, \ldots T_n\)</span> be the immediate subtrees of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> respectively, ordered from smallest to largest. Compare <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>, etc., until we get a pair of unequal trees <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(S_i &amp;gt; T_i\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(S &amp;gt; T\)</span>, and vice versa. Of course, of all pairs of immediate subtrees are equal, then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> will be equal.</p>
<p>This gives a linear order on unlabeled rooted trees, and one can prove that this is a well-order. Further, this well-ordering has order type <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta(\Omega^\omega,0)\)</span>. This definition is a modification of a well-ordering of ordered rooted trees due to Levitz, and expounded on in papers by Jervell.</p>
<p>From this well-ordering we can define fundamental sequences for ordinals up to <span class="math inline">\(\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)\)</span>. Simply put, given an ordinal <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha[n]\)</span> be the largest ordinal less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> corresponding to a tree of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices or less.</p>
<p>From this, we can define our version of the Hardy hierarchy:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0(n) = n\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_{\alpha + 1}( n) = H_{\alpha}( n+1)\)</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> a limit ordinal, <span class="math inline">\(H_{\alpha}( n) = H_{\alpha[n+1]}( n+1)\)</span></p>
<p>Note the <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>’s in the last line - this differs from the usual values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Of course, this will only make the functions larger.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_{\alpha}( n)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &amp;lt; \vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)\)</span> is the final index <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in the sequence of trees <span class="math inline">\(T_n, T_{n+1}, \ldots, T_m\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T_n\)</span> corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> is the largest tree with at most <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> vertices that is smaller than <span class="math inline">\(T_{i-1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_m\)</span> is the tree with one vertex. Thus <span class="math inline">\(H_{\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)}( n)\)</span> will be the final index <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in the sequence of trees <span class="math inline">\(T_{n+1}, T_{n+2}, \ldots, T_m\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(T_{n+1}\)</span> is arbitrary.</p>
<p>Thus tree(n) <span class="math inline">\(\geq H_{\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)}( n) - n\)</span>.</p>
<p>So where does TREE(3) come in? Harvey Friedman himself explains in a post to the Foundations of Mathematics message boards:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-March/010260.html">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-March/010260.html</a></p>
<p>In the post he explains why a proof of the theorem “TREE(3) exists” in the theory <span class="math inline">\(ACA_0 + Pi^1_2 - BI\)</span> must have more than 2^^1000 symbols. He does this by showing that TREE(3) must be very large - specifically, he constructs a sequence of more than <span class="math inline">\(n(4)\)</span> rooted trees labeled from {1,2,3} such that <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> vertices, for no <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i &amp;lt; j\)</span> do we have <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> homeomorphically embeddable into <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span>, and each tree contains either a 2 label or a 3 label. We can obviously continue this with tree(<span class="math inline">\(n(4)\)</span>) trees with all labels 1. Thus we have</p>
<p>TREE(3) <span class="math inline">\(\geq\)</span> tree<span class="math inline">\((n(4)) + n(4) \geq H_{\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)}(n(4))\)</span></p>
<p>In fact, we can do somewhat better than this; we can replace the <span class="math inline">\(n(4)\)</span> above by <span class="math inline">\(F(4)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(F(4)\)</span> is defined as the length of the longest sequence of sequences <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots x_n\)</span> from {1,2,3,4} such that <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> has length <span class="math inline">\(i+1\)</span> and for no <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i &amp;lt; j\)</span> do we have <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> a subsequence of <span class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span>. I can prove much better bounds for <span class="math inline">\(F(4)\)</span> than Friedman’s lower bound for <span class="math inline">\(n(4)\)</span>; specifically,</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(F(4) &amp;gt; f_{\omega^2 + \omega + 1}f_{\omega^2 + \omega + 1}f_{\omega^2 + \omega}f_{\omega^2 + 1}f_{\omega^2 + 1}f_{\omega^2}f_{ \omega + 1}f_{ \omega + 1}f_{\omega}(30)\)</span></p>
<p>But such specificity is perhaps unwarranted given how far from TREE(3) it may be.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 13)</h4>
<p>I should perhaps have asked this question to Harvey Friedman himself… Anyway, a reasonable answer is given on the Talk page for Wikipedia article on Kruskal tree theorem : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem#Correcting_TREE.282.29" rel="noreferrer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem#Correcting_TREE.282.29</a> , where one can find this quotation (from H. Friedman himself) : “Also, numbers derived from Goodstein sequences or Paris/Harrington Ramsey theory, although bigger than n(4), are also completely UNNOTICEABLE in comparison to TREE[3].” To precise my remarks (and answer Dylan Thurston), I meant that TREE(3) is bigger than expressions like <span class="math inline">\(n^{n^{n(100)}(100)}(100)\)</span>, say, where again exponentiation means iteration, and the whole expression has no more than <span class="math inline">\(n(4)\)</span> symbols ; this would indeed be true if, for instance, as suggested, we had TREE(3)<span class="math inline">\(&amp;gt;f_{\Gamma_0}(n(4))\)</span>. For reference, I should have added that TREE(3) is the incredibly (at first, or even second look) large answer to the question : “which is the length of the longest sequence <span class="math inline">\((T_2,T_3,T_4,\dots,T_n)\)</span> of labeled trees such that <span class="math inline">\(T_k\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> nodes labeled <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> is not a subtree of <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i &amp;lt; j\)</span> ?”.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 8)</h4>
<p>(Following are two comments, posted this way because I (“r.e.s.”) cannot post comments directly.)</p>
<p>Comment on the <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/93828/how-large-is-tree3/95588#95588">answer by “Deedlit”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not quite right. His first tree <span class="math inline">\(T_1\)</span> uses label 3 (so this label cannot be used later at all), followed by more than <span class="math inline">\(n(4)\)</span> trees using labels 1,2 – not, as you wrote, using labels 2,3. <em>It’s because of the way these latter {1,2}-labelled trees are constructed</em>, that they can nevertheless be followed by a long sequence of trees using only label 1. (I show the beginning of his sequence in my other comment below, using bracket expressions in which the bracket-types <code>(),[],{}</code> correspond to his labels 1,2,3 respectively.)</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, we can do even better, although these may be relatively “small” adjustments: by playing with various ways to start a long embedding-free sequence, one can improve upon the sequence constructed by Friedman (displayed below), but still using his method of coding <span class="math inline">\(n()\)</span>- or <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span>-type longest word-sequences via certain subtrees. For example, one can find sequences that demonstrate (in Deedlit’s notation)</p>
<p>TREE(3) <span class="math inline">\(\ \geq \\)</span> tree<span class="math inline">\((N) + \\ N \ \geq \ H_{\vartheta (\Omega^{\omega}, 0)}(N)\)</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(N \ = \ F_\omega F_\omega F_\omega F_{\omega+1} F_\omega F_\omega \ F(4)\)</span></p>
<p>with <span class="math inline">\(F_\alpha\)</span> being a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-growing_hierarchy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">fast-growing hierarchy</a> <em>that <strong>begins</strong> with</em> <span class="math inline">\(F_0 = F\)</span>, rather than beginning as usual with <span class="math inline">\(F_0(x) = x+1\)</span>. (Friedman showed that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> eventually dominates every <span class="math inline">\(f_{\lt \omega^\omega}\)</span> in the usual fast-growing hierarchy.)</p>
<p>I’ve posted a <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/res0001/tree-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">very terse derivation-sketch of this result</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Comment on the <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/93828/how-large-is-tree3/93986#93986">answer by “Feldman Denis”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[TREE(3) is] the length of the longest sequence <span class="math inline">\((T_2,T_3,T_4,…,T_n)\)</span> of labeled trees such that <span class="math inline">\(T_k\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> nodes labeled <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(T_i\)</span> is not a subtree of <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i \lt j\)</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than “<em>is not a subtree of</em>”, that should be “<em>is not homeomorphically embeddable into</em>”, which is a very much more stringent requirement. (There might not even exist a longest such sequence in the less-stringent case. A similar situation occurs for Friedman’s <span class="math inline">\(n()\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F()\)</span> functions concerning word-sequences: these use “is not a <em>subsequence</em> of” rather than the less-stringent “is not a <em>substring</em> of”, there being no longest word-sequence in the latter case.) With this correction, and by starting with <span class="math inline">\(T_2\)</span>, the length of the resulting sequence will of course be TREE(3) - 1.</p>
<p>A convenient way of representing these trees is to use nested bracket expressions (well-formed in the usual way with pairs of matching brackets) involving only three bracket-types – say <code>()</code>,<code>[]</code>,<code>{}</code> – each tree being uniquely represented by a nest of such brackets (up to isomorphism with respect to sibling order). A <em>lower bound</em> on TREE(3) is then the length of a longest sequence <span class="math inline">\((X_1,X_2,…,X_n)\)</span> of nests such that each <span class="math inline">\(X_k\)</span> has at most <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> bracket pairs and no <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> is embedded in a later <span class="math inline">\(X_j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <em>is embedded in</em> <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> can be obtained from <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> by erasing zero or more pairs of matching brackets. (Thus, if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not embedded in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, then the tree represented by <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is not inf-and-label-preserving embeddable into the tree represented by <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>; the converse, however, does not hold.)</p>
<p>Because <span class="math inline">\(X_1\)</span> must be some single bracket-pair which cannot then appear in any later nest in an embedding-free sequence, it may be assumed that <span class="math inline">\(X_1=\\)</span><code>{}</code>, with all later nests using only the <em>two</em> bracket-types <code>(),[]</code>. Also, note that TREE(3) concerns trees with <em>unordered</em> siblings, so, for example, the nests <code>([]())</code> and <code>(()[])</code> are not regarded as distinct. (Some authors have treated wqo’s for rooted trees with <em>ordered</em> siblings, with corresponding “longest sequence” results.)</p>
<p>To illustrate the use of bracket expressions, here is a representation of the initial tree sequence used by Friedman to prove the lower bound mentioned by the OP:</p>
<pre class="text"><code>T1  {}
T2  [[]]
T3  [()()]
T4  [((()))]
T5  ([][][][])
T6  ([][][]((.html)))
T7  ([][]((.html)()()))
T8  ([][]((.html)(())))
T9  ([][]((((((.html)))))))
T10 ([][](((((.html))))))
T11 ([][]((((.html)))))
T12 ([][](((.html))))
T13 ([][]((.html)))
T14 ([][]())
...</code></pre>
<p><strong>NB</strong>: It should be noted that <a href="http://www.math.osu.edu/~friedman.8/pdf/EnormousInt112201.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the article linked by the OP</a> does <em>not</em> treat Friedman’s TREE function, but a rather different function TR. The confusion may be partly due to the fact that “TR” is also what Friedman called the TREE function before he changed it to the latter name in a <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-March/010279.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">follow-up article</a> to <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/pipermail/fom/2006-March/010260.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the one mentioned in Deedlit’s posting</a>.</p>

<p>This question should make fair sense because trace is coordinate independent.</p>
<p>A few other comments. We were hoping for something like:</p>
<p>“determinant is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by column vectors.”</p>
<p>This is nice because it captures the geometry simply, and it holds for any old set of vectors over <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span></span>.</p>
<p>The divergence application of trace is somewhat interesting, but again, not really what we are looking for.</p>
<p>Also, after looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)" rel="noreferrer">wiki</a> entry, I don’t get it. This then requires a matrix function, and I still don’t really see the relationship.</p>
<p>One last thing that we came up with; the trace of a matrix is the same as the sum of the eigenvalues. Since eigenvalues can be seen as the eccentricity of ellipse, trace may correspond geometrically to this. But we could not make sense of this.</p>

<p>If your matrix is geometrically projection (algebraically <span class="math inline">\(A^2=A\)</span>) then the trace is the dimension of the space that is being projected onto. This is quite important in representation theory.</p>

This problem turned out to be much more interesting than I originally thought. Let me give my solution, which seems to be slightly different from (but essentially the same as) the solution in the paper by Bremner and MacLeod (see Allan MacLeod’s answer).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong>. Let <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c\)</span> be positive integers. Then <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c+a} + \frac{c}{a+b}\)</span> can never be an odd integer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Let <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> be a positive odd integer. The equation <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c+a} + \frac{c}{a+b} = n\)</span> implies <span class="math display">\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc - (n-1)(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 0.\]</span> This describes a smooth cubic curve <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> in the projective plane that has at least six rational points (of the form <span class="math inline">\((1:-1:0)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1:-1:1)\)</span> and their cyclic permutations). Declaring one of these to be the origin, <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> is an elliptic curve over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q\)</span>. Bringing <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> in Weierstrass form, we obtain the isomorphic curve <span class="math display">\[E&#39;_n \colon y^2 = x \bigl(x^2 + (4n(n+3)-3)x + 32(n+3)\bigr)
                  =: x(x^2 + Ax + B).\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>, then there are obviously no positive solutions, so we assume <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 3\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(E_n(\mathbb R)\)</span> has two connected components, one of which contains the six `trivial’ points but no points with positive coordinates, whereas the other component does contain positive points. In the model <span class="math inline">\(E&#39;_n\)</span>, this component consists of points with negative <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate.
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Claim</strong>. If <span class="math inline">\((\xi,\eta) \in E&#39;_n(\mathbb Q)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\xi \ge 0\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly implies the statement of the theorem.</p>
<p>
To show the claim, let <span class="math inline">\(D = 2n + 5\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> is odd, positive, coprime with <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and divides <span class="math inline">\(A^2 - 4B = (2n-3)(2n+5)^3\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is an odd prime dividing <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(n \equiv -3 \bmod p\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(-D \equiv 1 \bmod p\)</span>. The equation <span class="math inline">\(B x^2 - D y^2 = z^2\)</span> has the solution <span class="math inline">\((x,y,z)=(1,4,4)\)</span>, so the Hilbert symbol <span class="math inline">\((B, -D)_p = 1\)</span> for all primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We will show:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If <span class="math inline">\((\xi,\eta) \in E&#39;_n(\mathbb Q)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\xi \neq 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = 1\)</span> for all primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Given this, the product formula for the Hilbert symbol implies <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_\infty = 1\)</span> and so <span class="math inline">\(\xi &amp;gt; 0\)</span> (since <span class="math inline">\(-D &amp;lt; 0\)</span>).
</p>
<p>
Note that <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = (\xi^2 + A \xi + B, -D)_p\)</span>. We first consider odd <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We note that when <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is not a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic integer, then <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> must be a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic square, so <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = 1\)</span>. So we can assume that <span class="math inline">\(\xi \in {\mathbb Z}_p\)</span>. There are three cases.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides neither <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> nor <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\xi \in {\mathbb Z}_p^\times\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = 1\)</span>, since both entries are <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic units. Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = (\xi^2 + A \xi + B, -D)_p = (B, -D)_p = 1\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(-D \equiv 1 \bmod p\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(-D\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic square, hence <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = 1\)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + Ax + B \equiv (x + A/2)^2 \bmod p\)</span>. So if <span class="math inline">\(\xi \in {\mathbb Z}_p^\times\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> must be a square mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = 1\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then as before, <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_p = (\xi^2 + A \xi + B, -D)_p = (B, -D)_p = 1\)</span>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
It remains to consider <span class="math inline">\(p = 2\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(n \equiv 1 \bmod 4\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(-D \equiv 1 \bmod 8\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_2 = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(n \equiv 3 \bmod 4\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(-D \equiv 5 \bmod 8\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -D)_2 = (-1)^{v_2(\xi)}\)</span>, and we have to show that the 2-adic valuation of <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> must be even. Note that in this case <span class="math inline">\(v_2(B) = 6\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A \equiv -3 \bmod 8\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(v_2(\xi)\)</span> is odd, then exactly one of the three terms <span class="math inline">\(\xi^3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A \xi^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B \xi\)</span> has minimal 2-adic valuation, which must be even, so it cannot be the first or the third term. This reduces us to <span class="math inline">\(\nu := v_2(\xi) \in \{1,3,5\}\)</span>. One then easily checks that <span class="math inline">\(\xi(\xi^2 + A\xi + B) = 4^\nu u\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(u \equiv -1 \bmod 4\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\nu = 1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u \equiv -3 \bmod 8\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(\nu = 3\)</span>. In all cases, <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> cannot be a square, and so points with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-coordinate <span class="math inline">\(\xi\)</span> cannot exist. This concludes the proof.
</p>
<p>
Note that when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, we have <span class="math inline">\(-D \equiv 3 \bmod 4\)</span> and also <span class="math inline">\(v_2(B) = 5\)</span>, so we lose control over the 2-adic Hilbert symbol.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
This is the previous version of this answer, which I leave here, since it may contain some points of interest.
</p>
<p>
The equation <span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{c+a} + \frac{c}{a+b} = n\)</span> gives rise to the elliptic curve <span class="math display">\[E_n \colon a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + abc - (n-1)(a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = 0.\]</span> You are asking for rational points on this curve (such that <span class="math inline">\(a+b, b+c, c+a \neq 0\)</span>). For odd positive <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> up to and including 17, this is a curve of rank zero (with 6 rational points), whereas for <span class="math inline">\(n = 19\)</span>, it has rank 1. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(E_{19}\)</span> has infinitely many rational points, and your equation has infinitely many solutions for <span class="math inline">\(n = 19\)</span>. I’ll do the computations and find one explicitly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>EDIT:</strong> As pointed out by Jeremy Rouse in a comment below, the integral solutions for <span class="math inline">\(n = 19\)</span> are not positive. More precisely, the real points <span class="math inline">\(E_n(\mathbb R)\)</span> form two connected components (the discriminant of <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> is positive), and it is the non-identity component that contains points with all positive coordinates (taking as the identity one of the six points like <span class="math inline">\((1:-1:0)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\((1:1:-1)\)</span>). So the question is whether there is odd <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such that there is a rational point on the non-identity component; then the rational points will be dense on this component and so there will be positive solutions. So far, no such <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> turned up, even though there are many such that <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> has positive rank.
</p>
<p>
<strong>FURTHER EDIT:</strong> I suspect that there really is no odd <span class="math inline">\(n &amp;gt; 0\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> has rational points on the non-identity component. One way of checking this for any given <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is to do (half of) a 2-isogeny descent on <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span>. This produces a number of curves of the form <span class="math inline">\(C_u \colon y^2 = u x^4 + v x^2 + w\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(v = 4n(n+3)-3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(uw = 32(n+3)\)</span> that are unramified double covers of <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span>. We consider the curves <span class="math inline">\(C_u\)</span> that have points over all completions of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q\)</span>. Then every rational point on <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> is the image of a rational point on one of these curves <span class="math inline">\(C_u\)</span>. Doing the computation, one obtains a set of curves <span class="math inline">\(C_u\)</span> that all have <span class="math inline">\(u &amp;gt; 0\)</span> (this is only experimental; I checked it for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> up to 9999). But if <span class="math inline">\(u &amp;gt; 0\)</span>, then [<span class="math inline">\(C_u\)</span> has only one real component — this is wrong, but the following is OK] the image of <span class="math inline">\(C_u(\mathbb R)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(E_n(\mathbb R)\)</span> is the identity component, so there can be no rational point on the other component. My feeling is that there might be a Brauer-Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points on the non-identity component for odd <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, but I don’t have enough time to check this. A possible approach would be to note that <span class="math display">\[E&#39;_n \colon y^2 = x \bigl(x^2 + (4n(n+3)-3)x + 32(n+3)\bigr)\]</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span>. If we can find a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(d(n)\)</span> such that for all rational points <span class="math inline">\((\xi,\eta) \in E&#39;_n(\mathbb Q)\)</span> (with <span class="math inline">\(\xi \neq 0\)</span>) the product <span class="math inline">\(\prod_p (\xi, -d(n))_p\)</span> of Hilbert symbols (over all finite places) is always <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>, then the claim follows from the product formula for the Hilbert symbol and <span class="math inline">\((\xi, -d(n))_\infty = -1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(\xi &amp;lt; 0\)</span>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>SUCCESS:</strong> For odd <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d(n) = 2n-3\)</span> works. One can check that <span class="math inline">\((\xi, 3-2n)_p = 1\)</span> for all primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Details later (it is getting late). Actually, <span class="math inline">\(d(n) = -5-2n\)</span> works better. See above.
</p>
<p>
Note that for even <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, there usually are <span class="math inline">\(C_u\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(u &amp;lt; 0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(E_n\)</span> has positive rank (the first exception seems to be <span class="math inline">\(n = 40\)</span>). So I would expect the Brauer-Manin obstruction to result from an interaction between <span class="math inline">\(p = 2\)</span> and the infinite place.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For <span class="math inline">\(n = 4\)</span>, the curve has also rank 1, which explains the existence of solutions. I’ll try to check if there are smaller ones than that given by you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>EDIT:</strong> The given solution is really the smallest (positive) one. The next larger one has numbers of 167 to 168 digits.

<section id="question-66" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Can anyone offer advice on roughly how much commutative algebra, homological algebra etc. one needs to know to do research in (or to learn) modern algebraic geometry. Would you need to be familiar with something like the contents of Eisenbud’s <em>Commutative Algebra: With a View Toward Algebraic Geometry</em>, or is less needed in reality? (I am familiar with more commutative algebra than that which is covered in Atiyah and MacDonald’s *Introduction to Commutative Algebra&quot;, but less than that which is covered in Eisenbud’s textbook.)</p>
<p>Also, is modern algebraic geometry concerned with abstractions such as schemes, sheaves, topological spaces, commutative and noncommutative rings etc., or is it just classical algebraic geometry in an abstract form? Perhaps more specifically, to do research in modern algebraic geometry, do you need to be familiar with classical algebraic geometry, or is it possible to think of algebraic geometry as an “abstract language” and do research based <em>just</em> on this perception?</p>
<p>While I suspect that, as with other branches of mathematics, “abstraction was invented to analyze the concrete”, with all the emphasis currently given to the understanding of abstract tools, for someone who is not very familiar with the subject (such as myself), it seems that algebraic geometry is a “mixture” of general topology and abstract algebra. Is this right? If not, succinctly my question is: how great an influence does classical algebraic geometry have on modern algebraic geometry today?</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 84)</h4>
<p>I agree with Donu Arapura’s complaint about the artificial distinction between modern and classical algebraic geometry. The only distinction to me seems to be chronological: modern work was done recently, while classical work was done some time ago. However, the questions being studied are (by and large) the same.</p>
<p>As I commented in <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/3041/the-importance-of-ega-and-sga-for-students-of-today/14550#14550">another post</a>, two of the most important recent results in algebraic geometry are the deformation invariance of plurigenera for varieties of general type, proved by Siu, and the finite generation of the canoncial ring for varieties of general type, proved by Birkar, Cascini, Hacon, and McKernan, and independently by Siu. Both these results would be of just as much interest to the Italians, or to Zariski, as they are to us today. Indeed, they lie squarely on the same axis of research that the Italians, and Zariski, were interested in, namely, the detailed understanding of the birational geometry of varieties.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, to understand these results, I don’t think that you will particularly need to learn the contents of Eisenbud’s book (although by all means do learn them if you enjoy it); rather, you will need to learn geometry! And by geometry, I don’t mean the abstract foundations of sheaves and schemes (although these may play a role), I mean specific geometric constructions (blowing up, deformation theory, linear systems, harmonic representatives of cohomology classes – i.e. Hodge theory, … ). To understand Siu’s work you will also need to learn the analytic approach to algebraic geometry which is introduced in Griffiths and Harris.
</p>
<p>
In summary, if you enjoy commutative algebra, by all means learn it, and be confident that it supplies <em>one</em> road into algebraic geometry; but if you are interested in algebraic geometry, it is by no means required that you be an expert in commutative algebra.<br> The central questions of algebraic geometry are much as they have always been (birational geometry, problems of moduli, deformation theory, …), they are problems of geometry, not algebra, and there are many available avenues to approach them: algebra, analysis, topology (as in Hirzebruch’s book), combinatorics (which plays a big role in some investigations of Gromov–Witten theory, or flag varieties and the Schubert calculus, or … ), and who knows what others.

<p>I’m not an algebraic geometer, but I do know several algebraic geometers and it’s clear that modern algebraic geometry is a very large field some aspects of which involve technical modern abstractions (stacks!) others of which are in a more combinatorial direction (toric varieties, Grobner bases) and others involve more classical algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>However, I want to remake a point I made <a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2009/05/13/thoughts-on-graduate-school/">on my blog</a>, which is that later on in your career you will be much better at learning things than you are now. As a result it’s counterproductive to worry too much about what you should be learning now to maximize your efficiency of learning. Instead you should prioritize things you can learn now and which you enjoy learning now. Certainly you should start with an introductory algebraic geometry book, but once you’re done with that there’s no harm in looking at Eisenbud and seeing if you enjoy it. But if it’s too hard going or if you feel like you’re not fully appreciating it then go ahead and try reading something totally different. There’ll be plenty of time to learn more commutative algebra while you’re a grad student!</p>

<p>For several beautiful and expert discussions of the contrasts and relations between classical and the evolving subject of abstract or modern algebraic geometry, I recommend the following ICM lectures:</p>
<p>
O.Zariski, 1950, vol.2, p.77ff; B.Segre, 1954, vol.3, p.497ff; J.P.Serre, 1954, vol.3, p.515ff; A.Weil, 1954, vol.3, p.550ff; A.Grothendieck, 1958, p.103.
</p>
<p>(This falls obviously under the heading “reading the masters”.)</p>
<p>Indeed the whole algebraic geometry session, 1954, vol.3, pp.445-560, has an incredible list of short talks, (Groebner, Hirzebruch, Kodaira, Neron, Rosenlicht, Van der Waerden,…).</p>
<p>the link is: <a href="http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/</a></p>
<p>
My apologies for such a brief answer.<br> The article by Zariski, THE FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF ABSTRACT ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY, points out the advances in commutative algbra motivated by the need to substantiate results in geometry. “The past 25 years have witnessed a remarkable change in the field of algebraic geometry, a change due to the impact of the ideas and methods of modern algebra. What has happened is that this old and venerable sector of pure geometry underwent (and is still undergoing) a process of arithmetization. This new trend has caused consternation in some quarters. It was criticized either as a desertion of geometry or as a subordination of discovery to rigor. I submit that this criticism is unjustified and arises from some misunderstanding of the object of modern algebraic geometry. This object is not to banish geometry or geometric intuition, but to equip the geometer with the sharpest possible tools and effective controls.”
</p>
<p>That by Segre argues for the preservation of geometric intuition in algebraic geometry for just this reason, for motivating and suggesting new questions to investigate. It seems particularly articulate and impassioned as he is arguing for a tradition that seems threatened to be lost.</p>
<p>
GEOMETRY UPON AN ALGEBRAIC VARIETY BENIAMINO SEGRE I. Algebraic geometry — that is to say, the branch of geometry which deals with the properties of entities represented by algebraic equations — has in recent years developed in two distinct directions, which in a sense are opposed to one another. One of these directions is called abstract in as much as it is concerned with algebraic equations defined over commutative fields subject only to slight restrictions; here the means employed are purely algebraic, including in particular ideal theory and valuation theory. The other direction may properly be called geometrical) this usually deals with algebraic equations in the complex domain, and from time to time appeals to ideas and methods of analytic and projective geometry, topology, the theories of analytic functions and of differential forms. The dualism between these two disciplines has close relationship and affi- nity with that which, three centuries ago, arose between l’esprit géométrique of Descartes and l’esprit de finesse of Pascal, and which, in the past century, on the one hand divided the geometers into analysts of the school of Plücker and synthesists of the school of Steiner and, on the other, the algebraists into purists à la Dedekind and arithmetizers à la Kronecker. However, this dualism, instead of proving harmful to geometry, offers undoubted advantages when the two lines of development, with their respective merits and possibilities, are regarded not as contrasting but as complementary. We cannot fail to recognise in the abstract method and its technique a peculiar elegance, an impeccable logical coherence, and to appreciate the im- portance of the results so far obtained by it, particularly in the study of the foundations of geometry and the difficult questions concerning the singularities of algebraic varieties. But equally we cannot fail to recognise that the geometr- ical approach, with its greater concreteness, lends itself better to the formula- tion and initial study of new concepts and problems; and that it presents an incomparable wealth and colour of its own, due to the interweaving of many diverse strands, to the subtle and perspicuous play of geometrical intuition, and to the possibility of readily constructing examples and investigating special cases. We may also point out that, in the geometrical discipline, corresponding to a more definite notion of algebraic variety, there is a much wider range of subjects and a far greater number of orientations and contacts with other important branches of mathematics, which have found, and are finding, therein inspiration and extensions beyond the purely algebraic field.

ABSTRACT VERSUS CLASSICAL ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY ANDRé WEIL The word “classical”, in mathematics as well as in music, literature or most other branches of human endeavor, may be taken in a chronological sense; it then means anything which antedates whatever one chooses to consider as “modern”, and may be used to describe remote antiquity or the achievements of yesteryear, according to the mood and the age of the speaker. Sometimes, too, it is purely laudatory and is applied to any piece of work which is thought to be of permanent value. Here, however, while discussing algebraic geometry, I wish to use the words “classical” and “abstract” in a strictly technical sense which will be explained presently. Until not long ago algebraic geometers did their work exclusively with reference to the field of complex numbers; at the same time they worked on non-singular models, or at any rate their concern with multiple points was merely in order to try to push them out of the way by suitable birational trans- formations. Thus transcendental and topological tools of various kinds were available, and it was merely a matter of individual taste, personal inclination or expediency whether to use them or not on any given occasion. The most deci- sive progress ever made in the theory of algebraic curves was achieved by Riemann precisely by introducing such methods. Later authors took consider- able pains to obtain the same results by other means. In so doing, they were motivated, at least in part, by the fact that Riemann had given no justification for Dirichlet’s principle and that it took many years to find one. Similarly, the use of topological methods by Poincaré and Picard, not to mention some more recent writers, has often been such as to justify doubts about the validity of their proofs, while conversely it has happened that theorems which had merely been made plausible by so-called geometrical reasoning were first put beyond doubt by the transcendental theory. Now we have progressed beyond that stage. Rigor has ceased to be thought of as a cumbersome style of formal dress that one has to wear on state occasions and discards with a sigh of relief as soon as one comes home. We do not ask any more whether a theorem has been rigorously proved but whether it has been proved. At the same time we have acquired the techniques whereby our prede- cessors’ ideas and our own can be expanded into proofs as soon as they have reached the necessary degree of maturity; no matter whether such ideas are based on topology or analysis, on algebra or geometry, there is little excuse left for presenting them in incomplete or unfinished form. What, then, is the true scope of the various methods which we have learnt to handle in algebraic geometry? The answer is obvious enough. Let us call “classical” those methods which, by their very nature, depend upon the pro- perties of the real and of the complex number-fields; such methods may be derived from topology, calculus, convergent series, partial differential equations or analytic function-theory. As examples, one may quote the use of the differ- ential calculus in the proof of the Kronecker-Castelnuovo theorem, of theta- functions in the theory of elliptic curves and abelian varieties, of topology in the proof of the “principle of degeneracy”. Let us call “abstract” those methods which, being basically algebraic, are essentially applicable to arbitrary ground- fields; this includes for instance the theory of differentials of the first, second and third kinds (but of course not that of their integrals) and the greater part of the “geometric” proofs of the Italian school. Thus it is plain that, in all cases where an abstract proof is available, it may be expected to yield more than any classical proof for the same result. No one could deny this unless he had made up his mind to ignore fields of non-zero characteristic and was prepared to maintain that a theorem in algebraic geometry which has been proved for the field of complex numbers can always be extended to any field of characteristic 0. There are indeed many cases where this is so; quite often, however, the exten- sion can only be made to algebraically closed fields. As to denying any existence to algebraic geometry of non-zero characteristic, not merely would this, in view of recent developments, amount to denying motion; it would also deprive algebraic geometry of a rich and promising field of possible applications to number-theory, where one cannot do without reduction modulo p.

<h3>68: Thinking and Explaining (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/38639.html">45652</a> in 2016)</h3>
<section id="question-67" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<blockquote>
How big a gap is there between how you think about mathematics and what you say to others? Do you say what you’re thinking? Please give either personal examples of how your thoughts and words differ, or describe how they are connected for you.
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve been fascinated by the phenomenon the question addresses for a long time. We have complex minds evolved over many millions of years, with many modules always at work. A lot we don’t habitually verbalize, and some of it is very challenging to verbalize or to communicate in any medium. Whether for this or other reasons, I’m under the impression that mathematicians often have unspoken thought processes guiding their work which may be difficult to explain, or they feel too inhibited to try. One prototypical situation is this: there’s a mathematical object that’s obviously (to you) invariant under a certain transformation. For instant, a linear map might conserve volume for an ‘obvious’ reason. But you don’t have good language to explain your reason—so instead of explaining, or perhaps after trying to explain and failing, you fall back on computation. You turn the crank and without undue effort, demonstrate that the object is indeed invariant.</p>
<p>Here’s a specific example. Once I mentioned this phenomenon to Andy Gleason; he immediately responded that when he taught algebra courses, if he was discussing cyclic subgroups of a group, he had a mental image of group elements breaking into a formation organized into circular groups. He said that ‘we’ never would say anything like that to the students. His words made a vivid picture in my head, because it fit with how I thought about groups. I was reminded of my long struggle as a student, trying to attach <em>meaning</em> to ‘group’, rather than just a collection of symbols, words, definitions, theorems and proofs that I read in a textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> I’m not advocating that we turn mathematics into a touchy-feely subject. I’m not claiming that the phenomenon I’ve observed is universal. I <em>do</em> think that paying more attention than current custom to how you and others are really thinking, to the intuitions, is helpful both in proving theorems and in explaining mathematics.</p>
<p>I’m very curious about the varied ways that people think, and I would like to hear.</p>
<p>What am I really thinking? I’m anxious about offending the guardians of the forum and being scolded (as they have every right to do) for going against clearly stated advice with a newbie mistake. But I can’t help myself because I’m very curious how you will answer, and I can endure being scolded.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 143)</h4>
<p>I find there is a world of difference between explaining things to a colleague, and explaining things to a close collaborator. With the latter, one really can communicate at the intuitive level, because one already has a reasonable idea of what the other person’s mental model of the problem is. In some ways, I find that throwing out things to a collaborator is closer to the mathematical thought process than just thinking about maths on one’s own, if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>One specific mental image that I can communicate easily with collaborators, but not always to more general audiences, is to think of quantifiers in game theoretic terms. Do we need to show that for every epsilon there exists a delta? Then imagine that you have a bag of deltas in your hand, but you can wait until your opponent (or some malicious force of nature) produces an epsilon to bother you, at which point you can reach into your bag and find the right delta to deal with the problem. Somehow, anthropomorphising the “enemy” (as well as one’s “allies”) can focus one’s thoughts quite well. This intuition also combines well with probabilistic methods, in which case in addition to you and the adversary, there is also a Random player who spits out mathematical quantities in a way that is neither maximally helpful nor maximally adverse to your cause, but just some randomly chosen quantity in between. The trick is then to harness this randomness to let you evade and confuse your adversary.</p>
<p>Is there a quantity in one’s PDE or dynamical system that one can bound, but not otherwise estimate very well? Then imagine that it is controlled by an adversary or by Murphy’s law, and will always push things in the most unfavorable direction for whatever you are trying to accomplish. Sometimes this will make that term “win” the game, in which case one either gives up (or starts hunting for negative results), or looks for additional ways to “tame” or “constrain” that troublesome term, for instance by exploiting some conservation law structure of the PDE.</p>
<p>For evolutionary PDEs in particular, I find there is a rich zoo of colourful physical analogies that one can use to get a grip on a problem. I’ve used the metaphor of an egg yolk frying in a pool of oil, or a jetski riding ocean waves, to understand the behaviour of a fine-scaled or high-frequency component of a wave when under the influence of a lower frequency field, and how it exchanges mass, energy, or momentum with its environment. In one extreme case, I ended up rolling around on the floor with my eyes closed in order to understand the effect of a gauge transformation that was based on this type of interaction between different frequencies. (Incidentally, that particular gauge transformation won me a Bocher prize, once I understood how it worked.) I guess this last example is one that I would have difficulty communicating to even my closest collaborators. Needless to say, none of these analogies show up in my published papers, although I did try to convey some of them in my PDE book eventually.</p>
<p>ADDED LATER: I think one reason why one cannot communicate most of one’s internal mathematical thoughts is that one’s internal mathematical model is very much a function of one’s mathematical upbringing. For instance, my background is in harmonic analysis, and so I try to visualise as much as possible in terms of things like interactions between frequencies, or contests between different quantitative bounds. This is probably quite a different perspective from someone brought up from, say, an algebraic, geometric, or logical background. I can appreciate these other perspectives, but still tend to revert to the ones I am most personally comfortable with when I am thinking about these things on my own.</p>
<p>ADDED (MUCH) LATER: Another mode of thought that I and many others use routinely, but which I realised only recently was not as ubiquitious as I believed, is to use an “economic” mindset to prove inequalities such as <span class="math inline">\(X \leq Y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(X \leq CY\)</span> for various positive quantities <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span>, interpreting them in the form “If I can afford <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, can I therefore afford <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?” or “If I can afford lots of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, can I therefore afford <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?” respectively. This frame of reference starts one thinking about what types of quantities are “cheap” and what are “expensive”, and whether the use of various standard inequalities constitutes a “good deal” or not. It also helps one understand the role of weights, which make things more expensive when the weight is large, and cheaper when the weight is small.</p>
<p>ADDED (MUCH, MUCH) LATER: One visualisation technique that I have found very helpful is to incorporate the ambient symmetries of the problem (a la Klein) as little “wobbles” to the objects being visualised. This is most familiarly done in topology (“rubber sheet mathematics”), where every object considered is a bit “rubbery” and thus deforming all the time by infinitesimal homeomorphisms. But geometric objects in a scale-invariant problem could be thought of as being viewed through a camera with a slightly wobbly zoom lens, so that one’s mental image of these objects is always varying a little in size. Similarly, if one is in a translation-invariant setting, one’s mental camera should be sliding back and forth just a little to remind you of this, if one is working in a Euclidean space then the camera might be jiggling through all the rigid motions, and so forth. A more advanced example: if the problem is invariant under tensor products, as per the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/09/05/amplification-arbitrage-and-the-tensor-power-trick/">tensor product trick</a>, then one’s low dimensional objects should have a tiny bit of shadowing (or perhaps look like one of these 3D images when one doesn’t have the polarised glasses, with the slightly separated red and blue components) that suggest that they are projections of a higher dimensional Cartesian product.</p>
<p>One reason why one wants to do this is that it helps suggest useful normalisations. If one is viewing a situation with a wobbly zoom lens and there is some length that appears all over one’s analysis, one is reminded that one can spend the scale invariance of the problem to zoom up or down as appropriate to normalise this scale to equal 1. Similarly for other ambient symmetries.</p>
<p>This sort of wobbling of symmetries is also available in less geometric settings. When viewing, say, a graph on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices, perhaps the labels <span class="math inline">\(1,\dots,n\)</span> on the vertices have a tendency to swap with each other every so often, to emphasise the symmetry of relabeling in graph theory. Similarly, when dealing with a set <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b,c,d,\dots\}\)</span>, perhaps the positions of the elements <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\)</span> in one’s enumeration of the set are volatile and swap places every so often. In analysis, one often only cares about the order of magnitude of some very large or very small quantity X, rather than its exact value; so one should view this quantity as being a bit squishy in size, growing or shrinking by a factor of two or so every time one looks at the problem. If there is some probability theory in one’s problem, and some of your objects are random variables rather than deterministic variables, then you can imagine that every so often the “game resets”, with the random variables jumping around to different values in their range (and any quantities depending on these variables changing accordingly), whereas the deterministic variables stay fixed. Similarly if one has generic points in a variety, or nonstandard objects in a space (with the point being that if something bad happens if, say, your generic point is trapped in a subvariety, you can “reset the game” in which the generic point is now outside the subvariety; similarly one can “reset” an unbounded nonstandard number to be larger than any given standard number, etc.).</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 86)</h4>
<p>Final addition:</p>
<p>Since I’ve produced many rambles, I thought I’d close my (anti-)contribution with a distilled version of the example I’ve attempted below. It’s still something very standard, but, I hope, in the spirit of the original question. I’ll describe it as if it were a personal thing.</p>
<p>Almost always, I think of an integer as a function of the primes. So for 20, say,</p>
<p>20(2)= 0</p>
<p>20(3)=2</p>
<p>20(5)=0</p>
<p>20(7)=6</p>
<p>
. .
</p>
<p>20(19)=1</p>
<p>20(23)=20</p>
<p>20(29)=20</p>
<p>20(31)=20</p>
<p>20(37)=20</p>
<p>
. . .
</p>
<p>It’s quite a compelling image, I think, an integer as a function that varies in this way for a while before eventually leveling off. But, for a number of reasons, I rarely mention it to students or even to colleagues. Maybe I should.</p>
<hr>
<p>Original answer:</p>
<p>
It’s unclear if this is an appropriate kind of answer, in that I’m not putting forward anything very specific. But I’ll take the paragraph in highlight at face value.
</p>
<p>
I find it quite hard to express publicly my <em>vision</em> of mathematics, and I think this is a pretty common plight. Part of the reason is the difficulty of putting into words a sense of things that ultimately stems from a view of the landscape, as may be suggested by the metaphor. But another important reason is the disapprobation of peers. To appeal to hackneyed stereotypes, each of us has in him/her a bit of Erdos, a bit of Thurston, and perhaps a bit of Grothendieck, of course in varying proportions depending on education and temperament. I think I saw somewhere on this site the sentiment that ‘a bad Erdos still might be an OK mathematician, but a bad Grothendieck is really terrible,’ or something to that effect. This opinion is surrounded by a pretty broad consensus, I think. If I may be allowed some cliches now from the world of finance, it’s almost as though definite mathematical results are money in the bank. After you’ve built up some savings, you can afford to spend a bit by philosophizing. But then, you can’t let the balance get too low because people will start looking at you in funny, suspicious ways. I know that on the infrequent occasions* that I get carried away and convey at any length my vision of how a certain area of mathematics should work, what should be true and why, compelling analogies, and so on, I feel rather embarrassed for a little while. It feels like I am indeed running out of money and will need to back up the highfalutin words with some theorems (or at least lemmas) relatively soon. (And then, so many basically sound ideas are initially mistaken for trivial reasons.)
</p>
<p>
Now, I wish to make it clear that unlike Grothendieck (see the beginning paragraphs of this <a href="http://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Letters/GtoF.pdf" rel="noreferrer">letter to Faltings</a>) I find this quite sensible a state of affairs. For myself, it seems to be pretty healthy that my tendency to philosophize is held in check by the demand of the community that I have something to show for it. I grant that this may well be because my own visions are so meagre in comparison to Grothendieck’s. In any case, the general phenomenon itself is interesting to observe, in myself and in others.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, I find the peer pressure in question remarkably democratic. Obviously, a well-established mathematician typically has more money than average in the bank, so to speak. But it’s not a few times I’ve observed eminent people during periods of slowdown, being gradually ignored or just tolerated in their musings by many young people, even students.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, if you’re an energetic youngster with some compelling vision of an area of mathematics, it may not be so bad to let loose. If you have a really good business idea, it may even make sense to take out a large loan. And provided you have the right sort of personality, the pressure to back up your philosophical bravado with results may spur you on to great things. This isn’t to say you won’t have to put up with perfectly reasonable looks of incredulity, even from me, possibly for years.
</p>
<hr>
<p>*Maybe it seems frequent to my friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>Added:</p>
<p>
Since I commented above on something quite general, here is an attempt at a specific contribution. It’s not at all personal in that I’m referring to a well-known point of view in Diophantine geometry, whereby solutions to equations are <em>sections of fiber bundles</em>. Some kind of a picture of the fiber bundle in question was popularized by Mumford in his Red Book. I’ve discovered a reproduction on <a href="http://www.neverendingbooks.org/index.php/mumfords-treasure-map.html" rel="noreferrer">this page</a>. The picture there is of <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\mathbb{Z}[x])\)</span>, but interesting equations even in two variables will conjure up a more complicated image of an arithmetic surface fibered over the ‘arithmetic curve’ <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\mathbb{Z})\)</span>. A solution to the equation will then be a section of the bundle cutting across the fibers, also in a complicated manner. Much interesting work in number theory is concerned with how the sections meet the singular fibers.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, I’ve had many different thoughts about this perspective. For me personally, it was truly decisive, in that I hadn’t been very interested in number theory until I realized, almost with a shock, that the study of solutions to equations had been ‘reduced’ to the study of maps between spaces of a quite rigid sort. In recent years, I think I’ve also reconciled myself with the more classical view, whereby numbers are some kinds of algebraic gadgets. That is, thinking about matters purely algebraically does seem to provide certain flexible modes that can be obscured by the insistence on geometry. I’ve also discovered that there is indeed a good deal of variation in how compelling the inner picture of a fiber bundle can be, even among seasoned experts in arithmetic geometry. Nevertheless, it’s clear that the geometric approach is important, and informs a good deal of important mathematics. For example, there is an elementary but key step in Faltings’ proof of the Mordell conjecture referred to as the ‘Kodaira-Parshin trick,’ whereby you (essentially) get a compact curve <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of genus at least two to <em>parametrize</em> a smooth family of curves <span class="math display">\[Y\rightarrow X.\]</span> Then, whenever you have a rational point <span class="math display">\[P:Spec(\mathbb{Q})\rightarrow X\]</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, you can look at the fiber <span class="math inline">\(Y_P\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> above <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, which is itself a curve. The argument is that if you have too many points <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, you get too many good curves over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. What is good about them? Well, they all spread out to arithmetic surfaces over the spectrum of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> that are singular only over a fixed set of places. This part can be made obvious by spreading out both <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and the map between them over the integers as well, right at the outset. If you don’t have that picture in mind, the goodness of the <span class="math inline">\(Y_P\)</span> is not at all easy to explain.
</p>
<p>Anyways, what I wanted to say is that the picture of solutions as sections to fiber bundles is really difficult to explain to people without a certain facility in scheme theory. Because it seems so important, and because it is a crucial ingredient in my own thinking, I make an attempt every now and then in an exposition at the colloquium level, and fail miserably. I notice almost none of my colleagues even try to explain it in a general talk.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve mentioned already that this is far from a personal image of a mathematical object. But it still seems to be a good example of a very basic picture that you refrain from putting into words most of the time. If it really had been only a personal vision, it may even have been all but maddening, the schism between the clarity of the mental image and what you’re able to say about it. Note that the process of putting the whole thing into words in a convincing manner in fact took thousands of pages of foundational work.</p>
<hr>
<p>Added again:</p>
<p>
Professor Thurston: To be honest, I’m not sure about the significance of competing mental images in this context. If I may, I would like to suggest another possibility. It isn’t too well thought out, but I don’t believe it to be entirely random either.
</p>
<p>
Many people from outside the area seem to have difficulty understanding the picture I mentioned <em>because they are intuitively suspicious of its usefulness</em>. Consider a simpler picture of the real algebraic curve that comes up when one studies cubic equations like <span class="math display">\[E: y^2=x^3-2.\]</span> There, people are easily convinced that geometry is helpful, especially when I draw the tangent line at the point <span class="math inline">\(P=(3,5)\)</span> to produce another rational point. What is the key difference from the other picture of an arithmetic surface and sections? My feeling is it has mainly to do with the suggestion that the point itself has a complicated geometry encapsulated by the arrow <span class="math display">\[P:Spec(\Bbb{Z})\rightarrow E.\]</span> That is, spaces like <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\Bbb{Q})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\Bbb{Z})\)</span> are problematic and, after all, are quite radical.
</p>
<p>
In <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\Bbb{Q})\)</span>, one encounters the absurdity that the space <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\Bbb{Q})\)</span> itself is just a point. So one has to go into the whole issue that the point is equipped with a ring of functions, which happens to be <span class="math inline">\(\Bbb{Q}\)</span>, and so on. At this point, people’s eyes frequently glaze over, but not, I think, because this concept is too difficult or because it competes with some other view. Rather, the typical mathematician will be unable to <em>see the point</em> of looking at these commonplace things in this way. The temptation arises to resort to persuasion by authority then (such and such great theorem uses this language and viewpoint, etc.), but it’s obviously better if the audience can really appreciate the ideas through some first-hand experience, even of a simple sort. I do have an array of examples that might help in this regard, provided someone is kind enough to be still interested. But how helpful they really are, I’m quite unsure.
</p>
<p>
At the University of Arizona, we once had a study seminar on random matrices and number theory, to which I was called upon to contribute a brief summary of the analogous theory over finite fields. Unfortunately, this does involve some mention of sheaves, arithmetic fundamental groups, and some other strange things. Afterwards, my colleague Hermann Flaschka, an excellent mathematician with whom I felt I could speak easily about almost anything, commented that he couldn’t tell if the whole language just consisted of word associations or if some actual geometry was going on. Now, I’m sure this was due in part to my poor powers of exposition. But further conversation gave me the strong impression that the question that really went through his mind was: ‘How could it possibly be useful to think about these objects in this way?’
</p>
<p>
To restate my point, I think a good deal of conceptual inhibition comes from a kind of intuitive utilitarian concern. Matters are further complicated by the important fact that this kind of conceptual conservatism is perfectly sensible much of the time.
</p>
<p>By the way, my choice of example was somewhat motivated by the fact that it is quite likely to be difficult for people outside of arithmetic geometry, including many readers of this forum. This gives it a different flavor from the situations where we all understand each other more or less well, and focus therefore on pedagogical issues referring to classroom practice.</p>
<hr>
<p>Yet again:</p>
<p>Forgive me for being a bore with these repeated additions.</p>
<p>The description of your approach to lectures seems to confirm the point I made, or at least had somewhat in mind: When someone can’t understand what we try to explain, it’s maybe in his or her best interest (real or perceived) not to. It’s hard not to feel that this happens in the classroom as well oftentimes. This then brings up the obvious point that what we try to say is best informed by some understanding of who we’re speaking to as well as some humility*. As a corollary, what we <em>avoid</em> saying might equally well be thus informed.</p>
<p>My own approach, by the way, is almost opposite to yours. Of course I can’t absorb technical details just sitting there, but I try my best to concentrate for the whole hour or so, almost regardless of the topic. (Here in Korea, it’s not uncommon for standard seminar lectures to be <em>two</em> hours.) If I may be forgiven a simplistic generalization, your approach strikes me as common among deeply creative people, while perennial students like me tend to follow colloquia more closely. I intend neither flattery nor modesty with this remark, but only observation. Also, I am trying to create a complex picture (there’s that word again) of the problem of communication.</p>
<p>As to <span class="math inline">\(Spec(\Bbb{Z})\)</span>, perhaps there will be occasion to bore you with that some other time. Why don’t you post a question (assuming you are interested)? Then you are likely to get a great many perspectives more competent than mine. It might be an interesting experiment relevant to your original question.</p>
<hr>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 55)</h4>
<p>Just to talk about something fresh for which I still have a good memory of what I actually thought and what I wrote, let’s take <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/38019/zeros-of-gradient-of-positive-polynomials">this example</a></p>
<p>Thoughts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Ivan Fesenko teased me with the puzzle without the gradient condition 10 years ago. I solved it with the standard <span class="math inline">\((1-xy)^2+x^2\)</span>, but it would be nice to tease him with the upgraded puzzle when I talk to him next. Also, it is high time to finish it off.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard polynomial is even and the only critical point is a saddle. If you think of it, this saddle is inevitable: we have low points on the landscape on both sides of the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis and high values on the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>-axis going to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span> both ways.

<li><p>This works every time when the sequence of points where the polynomial goes to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> has two different limiting directions. Then we can separate them by a line and run the same argument. So, the limiting direction must be unique.</p></li>
<li><p>This seems impossible because the highest (even) degree homogeneous part should vanish in this direction but then it also vanishes in the opposite direction.

<li><p>We certainly need something to break the symmetry here. A polynomial family <span class="math inline">\(P_y(x)\)</span> of polynomials in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that have roots close to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(y\to+\infty\)</span> and no roots when <span class="math inline">\(y\to-\infty\)</span> would be nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Hey, I know this one: <span class="math inline">\(yx^2-1\)</span>. Let’s try <span class="math inline">\(x^2+(x^2y-1)^2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Damn, it doesn’t work. The origin is still a critical point.</p></li>
<li><p>Yeah, what else would you expect: the low points on the landscape are accumulating to one direction but still are separated by the line, so the mountain pass lemma is as powerful as before. To kill it, we need to shift both descends to one side.</p></li>
<li><p>Add <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(P_y(x)\)</span>. That won’t change the limiting direction but will shift the zeroes a bit. So, let’s try <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)=x^2+(x^2y+x+1)^2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The origin is good now: <span class="math inline">\(f_x=2\)</span> there. Actually, it is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> everywhere where <span class="math inline">\(x=0\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(x\ne 0\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f_y=0\)</span> only if <span class="math inline">\(x^2y+x+1=0\)</span> but then <span class="math inline">\(f_x=2x\ne 0\)</span> by the chain rule.</p></li>
<li><p>OK, let’s post the example and keep it in memory for teasing people…</p></li>

<h3>69: Why doesn’t mathematics collapse even though humans quite often make mistakes in their proofs? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/338607.html">45649</a> in 2019)</h3>
<section id="question-68" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>
To begin with, I am aware of these questions, which seems to be related: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/31337/how-do-i-fix-someones-published-error/">How do I fix someone's published error?</a>, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/23478/examples-of-common-false-beliefs-in-mathematics">Examples of common false beliefs in mathematics</a>, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/96510/when-have-we-lost-a-body-of-mathematics-because-errors-were-found">When have we lost a body of mathematics because errors were found?</a>, etc…
</p>
<p>My background: I am a senior undergraduate student in mathematics. Recently, I got a nice chance in a REU program, and started to read some journal articles. My impression was: any result in modern mathematics critically depends on another result, and that result depends on some other result, and ad infinitum.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some graduate students and professors in my university, who stand in quite intimate relations to me, say that, they do not check every details of proofs when they read mathematical monographs and research articles. They simply do not have enough time to read all the details and fill in the lines. (Clearly, I also do not read all the proofs in detail, if it seems to be so difficult or not much relevant to what I am interested in.)</p>
<p>
Finally, I’ve been heard of some stories on fatal mathematical errors. To be honest, I do not understand what the errors precisely are. What I’ve been heard about are some “urban legends”. (I intentionally didn’t write down the details of these urban legends, since if I write down everything I’ve heard, maybe someone working in the mentioned field may feel insulted…)
</p>
<p>For the above reasons, recently I am afraid of the situation where a field in mathematics collapse down because of a single, fatal, but very subtle error in the foundations of that field. In mathematics, everything seems to be so much intertwined, and it seems that no one actually checks every single detail in every mathematical articles.</p>
<p>
But the mathematics community seems to be very sound. Maybe at least one of the followings are true:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Actually, a typical mathematical result does not depend that much on other results. So whenever if possible, a mathematician can check the details of every results which is of interest to him/her.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Strictly speaking, rigor is actually not that important. Even if a mathematical result turns out to be false, there is still something true in the statement. Therefore, only minor changes will be needed, and all the results depending on the turned-out-to-be-false result remains sound.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are my questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Why the whole mathematics remains so sound, even though humans are imperfect and quite often produce errors? Are my explanations above correct?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a theorem turns out to be wrong, then mathematicians will try to correct (if possible) all the results depending on that theorem. How hard is this job? Isn’t it very tedious and frustrating? I want to hear some personal stories.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As an undergraduate student, I want to know if anybody who is much wiser, older, or experienced, had the same fear as mine. (Again, I want to hear some personal stories.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
As an undergraduate student who will get into a graduate school in the near future, I want to get some advice. Should I stop worrying and believe the authors of the books and articles I read? When should I check all the details, and when should I just accept the theorem as given?
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks to everyone for reading my question.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 175)</h4>
<p>In addition to the answers that have already been given, I think another reason that mathematics doesn’t collapse is that the fundamental content of mathematics is <em>ideas</em> and <em>understanding</em>, not only proofs. If mathematics were done by computers that mindlessly searched for theorems and proof but sometimes made mistakes in their proofs, then I expect that it would collapse. But usually when a human mathematician proves a theorem, they do it by achieving some new understanding or idea, and usually that idea is “correct” even if the first proof given involving it is not.</p>
<p>One recent and well-publicized story is that told by the late Vladimir Voevodsky in his note <a href="https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2014/voevodsky-origins" rel="noreferrer">The Origins and Motivations of Univalent Foundations</a>. Here’s a bit of one story that he tells about his own experience:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>my paper “Cohomological Theory of Presheaves with Transfers,” … was written… in 1992-93. [Only] In 1999-2000… did I discover that the proof of a key lemma in my paper contained a mistake and that the lemma, as stated, could not be salvaged. Fortunately, I was able to prove a weaker and more complicated lemma, which turned out to be sufficient for all applications….</p>
This story got me scared. Starting from 1993, multiple groups of mathematicians studied my paper at seminars and used it in their work and none of them noticed the mistake…. A technical argument by a trusted author, which is hard to check and looks similar to arguments known to be correct, is hardly ever checked in detail.
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know any of the details of the mathematics in this story, but the fact that he was able to prove a “weaker and more complicated lemma which turned out to be sufficient for all applications” matches my own experience. For instance, while working on a recent project I discovered no fewer than <em>nine</em> mistaken theorem statements (not just mistakes in proofs of correct theorems) in published or almost-published literature, including several by well-known experts (and two by myself). However, in <em>all</em> nine cases it was simple to strengthen the hypothesis or weaken the conclusion in such a way as to make the theorem true, in a way that sufficed for all the applications I know of.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is because the mistaken statements were based on correct <em>ideas</em>, and the mistakes were simply in making those ideas precise. Or to put it differently, mathematicians get our intuitions from “well-behaved” objects: sometimes that intuition can be wrong for “pathological” objects we didn’t know about, but in such cases we simply alter the definitions to exclude the pathological ones from consideration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people do sometimes get mistaken ideas. For instance, here’s another quote from Voevodsky’s article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In October 1998, Carlos Simpson … claimed to provide an argument that implied that the main result of the “∞-groupoids” paper, which Kapranov and I had published in 1989, cannot be true. However, Kapranov and I had considered a similar critique ourselves and had convinced each other that it did not apply. I was sure that we were right until the fall of 2013 (!!).</p>
I can see two factors that contributed to this outrageous situation: Simpson claimed to have constructed a counterexample, but he was not able to show where the mistake was in our paper. Because of this, it was not clear whether we made a mistake somewhere in our paper or he made a mistake somewhere in his counterexample. Mathematical research currently relies on a complex system of mutual trust based on reputations. By the time Simpson’s paper appeared, both Kapranov and I had strong reputations. Simpson’s paper created doubts in our result, which led to it being unused by other researchers, but no one came forward and challenged us on it.
</blockquote>
<p>In this case I do know something about the mathematics involved, and my own opinion is somewhat different from Voevodsky’s. In the 2000’s I was a graduate student working on higher category theory, and my impression was that in the community of higher category theory it was taken for granted that Simpson’s counterexample was correct and the Kapranov-Voevodsky paper was wrong, because the claimed KV result contradicted well-known ideas in the field.</p>
<p>The point here is that a community of people developing ideas together is likely to have arrived at correct intuitions, and these intuitions can flag “suspicious” results and lead to increased scrutiny of them. That is, when looking for mistaken ideas (as opposed to technical slips), it makes sense to give differing amounts of scrutiny to different claims based on whether they accord with the intuitions and expectations of experience.</p>
<p>So what do you do as a student? In addition to the other good advice that’s been given, I think one of your primary goals should be to train your own intuition. That way you will be better-able to evaluate whether a given result, or something like it, is probably true, before you decide whether to read and check the proof in detail.</p>
<p>Of course, there is also the position that Voevodsky was led to:</p>
<blockquote>
And I now do my mathematics with a proof assistant. I have a lot of wishes in terms of getting this proof assistant to work better, but at least I don’t have to go home and worry about having made a mistake in my work.
</blockquote>
<p>I have a lot of respect for that position; I do plenty of formalization in proof assistants myself, and am very supportive of it. But I don’t think that mathematics would be in danger of collapse without formalization, and I feel free to also do plenty of mathematics that would be prohibitively time-consuming to formalize in present-day proof assistants.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Redundancy is one big source of self-healing. A result with three different proofs is rather unlikely to be wrong. Also, people try to apply fresh results; wrong results often lead to contradictions when applied, alerting mathematicians to their wrongness. Same for proofs: Mistakes in proofs are often spotted when someone tries to adapt the proof to other questions.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
This is tricky. These days, using Google Scholar’s “cited by” feature and various other backlink aggregators, you can get a list of papers/book that reference a given paper. Thus, if you find an error in the literature, you can track down where the “corruption” has spread. But getting corrections published is very difficult. <a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1077&amp;context=rgp_rsr" rel="noreferrer">Ted Hill</a> and <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2017/02/13/journal-retracts-paper-state-senator-former-mathematician/" rel="noreferrer">Nikolai Mnev</a> are known for having struggled through the whole process of correcting someone else’s false claims, but lots of people end up staying silent or (these days) just posting what they know somewhere on a forum like MathOverflow when someone stumbles upon the same problem. Then there are situations where no specific error can be pinpointed, but important material is simply imprecise and unreadable; fields often linger in such a limbo until someone does the thankless job of building the foundations underneath them. <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-fight-to-fix-symplectic-geometry-20170209/" rel="noreferrer">Katrin Wehrheim</a> is one example of this.

<p>
<a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/309191/how-to-be-rigorous-about-combinatorial-algorithms">This question of mine</a> got 41 votes, so yes, this is a fairly well-acknowledged problem.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ask your advisor <strong>and</strong> others. You definitely want to understand all proofs in undergraduate and lower-level graduate classes; they aren’t particularly likely to be wrong, but you’ll use the ideas anyway. As for advanced theory you rely upon, it depends.

<h4>Answer 3 (score 29)</h4>
<p>This is a broad question, but you may find it helpful to read <A HREF="https://www.gwern.net/The-Existential-Risk-of-Mathematical-Error" rel="noreferrer">The Existential Risk of Math Errors</A>. It suggests a certain robustness of the mathematical edifice, which I actually think extends to the natural sciences as a whole. (Newtonian mechanics is “wrong” in a fundamental sense, but neither the development of relativistic mechanics nor the discovery of quantum mechanics has caused the collapse of classical mechanics.)</p>
<p>This quote in particular from Gian-Carlo Rota bears on your points 1 and 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When the Germans were planning to publish Hilbert’s collected papers and to present him with a set on the occasion of one of his later birthdays, they realized that they could not publish the papers in their original versions because they were full of errors, some of them quite serious. Thereupon they hired a young unemployed mathematician, Olga Taussky-Todd, to go over Hilbert’s papers and correct all mistakes. Olga labored for three years; it turned out that all mistakes could be corrected without any major changes in the statement of the theorems. There was one exception, a paper Hilbert wrote in his old age, which could not be fixed; it was a purported proof of the continuum hypothesis, you will find it in a volume of the Mathematische Annalen of the early thirties. At last, on Hilbert’s birthday, a freshly printed set of Hilbert’s collected papers was presented to the Geheimrat. Hilbert leafed through them carefully and did not notice anything.

<h3>70: Most memorable titles (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/44326.html">45615</a> in 2017)</h3>
<section id="question-69" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Given the vast number of new papers / preprints that hit the internet everyday, one factor that may help papers stand out for a broader, though possibly more casual, audience is their title. This view was my motivation for asking this question almost 7 years ago (<em>wow!</em>), and it remains equally true today (those who subscribe to arXiv feeds, MO feeds, etc., may agree).</p>
<hr>
<p>I was wondering if the MO-users would be willing to share their wisdom with me on what makes the title of a paper memorable for them; or perhaps just cite an example of title they find memorable?</p>
<p>This advice would be very helpful in helping me (and perhaps others) in designing better, more informative titles (not only for papers, but also for example, for MO questions).</p>
<p>One title that I find memorable is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Nineteen dubious ways to compute the exponential of a matrix,</strong> by Moler and van Loan.
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The response to this question has been quite huge. So, what have I learned from it? A few things at least. Here is my summary of the obvious: Amongst the various “memorable” titles reported, some of the following are true:</p>
<ol>
<li>
A title can be <em>memorable</em>, <em>attractive</em>, or even both (to oversimplify a bit);
</li>
<li>
A title becomes truly <em>memorable</em> if the accompanying paper had memorable substance
</li>
<li>
A title can be attractive even without having memorable material.
</li>
<li>
To reach the broadest audience, attractive titles are good, though mathematicians might sometimes feel irritated by needlessly cute titles
</li>
<li>
Titles that are bold, are usually short, have an element of surprise, but do not depart too much from the truth seems to be more attractive in general. 5.101 Mathematical succinctness might appeal to some people—but is perhaps not that memorable for me—so perhaps such titles are attractive, but maybe not memorable.
</li>
<li>
If you are a bigshot, you can get away with pretty much any title!

<h3>71: Coin Pusher Game (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/75346.html">45558</a> in )</h3>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>While doing laundry at my local laundromat, I saw a coin pusher game. Below is a picture, and here is a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Iz3-3x0lNE&amp;feature=related" rel="noreferrer">video</a> depicting how it works (disregard non-coins).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.simpalife.com/wp-content/uploads/Coin-Pushers-or-the-Fair-Quarters-Game.jpg" rel="noreferrer">alt text http://www.simpalife.com/wp-content/uploads/Coin-Pushers-or-the-Fair-Quarters-Game.jpg</a></p>
<p>Essentially, one has a distribution of coins on a table, and you get to drop one coin at a time at one end, which ends up being pushed into the table, thereby potentially pushing coins off the edge. Note that you can choose where you can drop your coin, width wise. For simplicity, assume coins cannot stack on each other.</p>
<p>My question is, are there known limit laws for this game? That is, if I specify a distribution of coins on the table, and then start dropping coins in randomly, what can be said about how the expected number of dropped coins fluctuates, per turn. Consequently, are there various phase transitions as a function of coin density? As well, if I feed coins at a specific spot, what will the distribution of coin falls look like as a function of the table width? Do the boundary conditions (the side walls and the pusher) create interesting “modes” in the coin falling distribution?</p>
<p>I would think that this has to do with sand stacking cascades and KPZ growth but, do not have much experience in this area. Or perhaps this is just a simple Galton box that produces a normal distribution?</p>

<p>I’m not a math guy so frankly I have almost zero understanding of what you are asking but I can tell you as a person who operates these games they pay out 30-50% depending on how they are adjustment. the main mode of adjustment is the side holes where money falls into and goes into the bottom of the machine (this is the oeprators profit) can be opened and closed to adjust the payout, if the hole is mostly closed they will pay out close to 50% of what they take in, if itss open they pay out around 30% there isnt much trick to how you put in the quaters are far as i know. also the angle of the lip will adjust the pay out as well.</p>

<p>I frequent a restaurant that has one of these machines. It has an upper level that moves toward the player then backwards. You can drop one quarter at a time through a movable slot so that you can drop several coins onto the upper shelf during one cycle.</p>
<p>The guys who work there have figured out pretty effective tactics and strategies for winning.</p>
<p>Strategy: Only play when quarters are built up heavily in the middle of the edge. (The sides don’t matter.) The quarters should look like they will fall at any moment. Some may be largely over the edge but stopped from falling by other quarters lying on them.</p>
<p>Tactic: During one cycle, drop four quarters as close together as you can get them at the center of the machine. They act like a bulldozer to push coins in the center of the upper shelf forward. These, in turn, fall to the the lower shelf and push coins in the center toward the edge. This strategy minimizes movement of coins toward the edge slots and maximizes the flow of coins forward.</p>

<h3>72: What elementary problems can you solve with schemes? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/59071.html">45509</a> in 2017)</h3>
<section id="question-71" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I’m a graduate student who’s been learning about schemes this year from the usual sources (e.g. Hartshorne, Eisenbud-Harris, Ravi Vakil’s notes). I’m looking for some examples of elementary self-contained problems that scheme theory answers - ideally something that I could explain to a fellow grad student in another field when they ask “What can you do with schemes?”</p>
<p>Let me give an example of what I’m looking for: In finite group theory, a well known theorem of Burnside’s is that a group of order <span class="math inline">\(p^a q^b\)</span> is solvable. It turns out an easy way to prove this theorem is by using fairly basic character theory (a later proof using only ‘elementary’ group theory is now known, but is much more intricate). Then, if another graduate student asks me “What can you do with character theory?”, I can give them this example, even if they don’t know what a character is.</p>
<p>Moreover, the statement of Burnside’s theorem doesn’t depend on character theory, and so this is also an example of character theory proving something external (e.g. character theory isn’t just proving theorems about character theory).</p>
<p>I’m very interested in learning about similar examples from scheme theory.</p>
<blockquote>
What are some elementary problems (ideally not depending on schemes) that have nice proofs using schemes?
</blockquote>
<p>Please note that I’m <b>not</b> asking for large-scale justification of scheme theoretic algebraic geometry (e.g. studying the Weil conjectures, etc). The goal is to be able to give some concrete notion of what you can do with schemes to, say, a beginning graduate student or someone not studying algebraic geometry.</p>

<p>A smooth projective variety over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> has only finitely many places of bad reduction. Shimura had a horribly complicated proof of this in the language of Weil’s foundations in a paper from the 50’s. With schemes, it’s completely obvious, as smoothness is an open condition. Even stating this without schemes is painful. The whole field of arithmetic geometry is an example of what you want. Actually, this is my only serious complaint about Hartshorne. He doesn’t do any Number Theory and <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{Spec}\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is where schemes really shine.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2-score-69" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 69)</h4>
<p>It seems to me that there are a lot of great answers here but I am not sure if they live up to the challenge of showing the usefulness of schemes through an <strong>elementary</strong> example.</p>
<p>Let me try my luck and risk the wrath of the MO crusaders.</p>
<p>Probably anyone having any kind of mathematical background have seen the classification of conics (a.k.a. plane quadrics) over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R\)</span>. Perhaps still a large percentage of those who saw this early in their mathematical career wondered about the asymmetry involved in that you have the usual nice ones (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola), the reasonable degenerate ones (two <em>different</em> lines, either intersecting or parallel), and then there are the weird ones (double line, point, empty set).</p>
<p>This last bunch, while clear from the proof seems odd and one might feel that they should not be considered. Now if one looks at them scheme theoretically, then it becomes completely clear how these fit into the same mold and how those “weird” ones are really the same as the nice ones (some points, some empty sets) or the “reasonable” degenerate ones (double lines, other points, other empty sets). The double line especially is hard to explain without schemes, while the other two “weird ones” are really a consequence of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb R\)</span> not being algebraically closed, although interestingly, the associated schemes actually kind of “see” the non-real points as well.</p>
<p>A more <em>high brow</em> version of the same idea is the fact that (say over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb C\)</span>) a family of elliptic curves (topologically tori) can degenerate to a nodal cubic curve (topologically a sphere with two points glued together) and a family of rational curves (topologically spheres) can also degenerate to the same object. This seems to lead to at least confusion if not to contradiction as it seems to indicate that a sphere can be continuously transformed into a torus. Looking at these families the proper way, that is, using schemes we see that the two degenerations are not producing the same scheme. The one coming from the rational curves will add an embedded point at the node while that embedded point does not appear in the family of elliptic curves.</p>

<p>This was my own motivation for learning schemes:</p>
<p>
Theorem (Mazur): If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an elliptic curve over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q\)</span>, then the torsion subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(E(\mathbb Q)\)</span> (the set of rational points of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>) is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n = 1, \dots, 10,\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(12\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z/2n\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n = 1,\ldots,4\)</span>.
</p>
<p>A special case (due to Mazur and Tate) is</p>
<p>Theorem: If <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is an elliptic curve over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> does not contain a rational point of order <span class="math inline">\(13\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is certainly a simple statement, but their proof uses the theory of schemes in a crucial way.</p>

<h3>73: Which popular games are the most mathematical? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13638.html">45072</a> in 2017)</h3>
<section id="question-72" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I consider a game to be mathematical if there is interesting mathematics (to a mathematician) involved in</p>
<ul>
<li>
the game’s structure,
</li>
<li>
optimal strategies,
</li>
<li>
practical strategies,
</li>
<li>
analysis of the game results/performance.
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
Which popular games are particularly mathematical by this definition?
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong>: I got into backgammon a bit over 10 years ago after overhearing Rob Kirby say to another mathematician at MSRI that he thought backgammon was a game worth studying. Since then, I have written over 100 articles on the mathematics of backgammon as a columnist for a backgammon magazine. My target audience is backgammon players, not mathematicians, so much of the material I cover is not mathematically interesting to a mathematician. However, I have been able to include topics such as martingale decomposition, deconvolution, divergent series, first passage times, stable distributions, stochastic differential equations, the reflection principle in combinatorics, asymptotic behavior of recurrences, <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span> statistical analysis, variance reduction in Monte Carlo simulations, etc. I have also made a few videos for a poker instruction site, and I am collaborating on a book on practical applications of mathematics to poker aimed at poker players. I would like to know which other games can be used similarly as a way to popularize mathematics, and which games I am likely to appreciate more as a mathematician than the general population will.</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
go
</li>
<li>
bridge
</li>
<li>
Set.
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-example</strong>: I do not believe chess is mathematical, despite the popular conception that chess and mathematics are related. Game theory says almost nothing about chess. The rules seem mathematically arbitrary. Most of the analysis in chess is mathematically meaningless, since positions are won, drawn, or tied (some minor complications can occur with the 50 move rule), and yet chess players distinguish strong moves from even stronger moves, and usually can’t determine the true value of a position.</p>
<p>To me, the most mathematical aspect of chess is that the linear evaluation of piece strength is highly correlated which side can win in the end game. Second, there is a logarithmic rating system in which all chess players say they are underrated by 150 points. (Not all games have good rating systems.) However, these are not enough for me to consider chess to be mathematical. I can’t imagine writing many columns on the mathematics of chess aimed at chess players.</p>
<p><strong>Non-example</strong>: I would exclude Nim. Nim has a highly mathematical structure and optimal strategy, but I do not consider it a popular game since I don’t know people who actually play Nim for fun.</p>
<hr>
<p>To clarify, I want the games as played to be mathematical. It does not count if there are mathematical puzzles you can describe on the same board. <strong>Does being a mathematician help you to learn the game faster, to play the game better, or to analyze the game more accurately?</strong> (As opposed to a smart philosopher or engineer…) If mathematics helps significantly in a game people actually play, particularly if interesting mathematics is involved in a surprising way, then it qualifies to be in this collection.</p>
<p>If my criteria seem horribly arbitrary as some have commented, so be it, but this seems in line with questions like <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/2556/real-world-applications-of-mathematics-by-arxiv-subject-area">Real world applications of math, by arxive subject area?</a> or <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/5450/cocktail-party-math">Cocktail party math</a>. I’m asking for applications of real mathematics to games people actually play. If someone is unconvinced that mathematics says anything they care about, and you find out he plays go, then you can describe something he might appreciate if you understand combinatorial game theory and how this arises naturally in go endgames.</p>

<h3>74: Why worry about the axiom of choice? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/22927.html">44529</a> in 2010)</h3>
<section id="question-73" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>As I understand it, it has been proven that the axiom of choice is independent of the other axioms of set theory. Yet I still see people fuss about whether or not theorem X depends on it, and I don’t see the point. Yes, one can prove some pretty disturbing things, but I just don’t feel like losing any sleep over it if none of these disturbing things are in conflict with the rest of mathematics. The discussion seems even more moot in light of the fact that virtually none of the weird phenomena can occur in the presence of even mild regularity assumptions, such as “measurable” or “finitely generated”.</p>
<p>So let me turn to two specific questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I am working on a problem which is not directly related to logic or set theory, can important mathematical insight be gained by understanding its dependence on the axiom of choice?</p>
If I am working on a problem and I find a two page proof which uses the fact that every commutative ring has a maximal ideal but I can envision a ten page proof which circumvents the axiom of choice, is there any sense in which my two page proof is “worse” or less useful?
</blockquote>
<p>The only answer to these questions that I can think of is that an object whose existence genuinely depends on the axiom of choice do not admit an explicit construction, and this might be worth knowing. But even this is largely unsatisfying, because often these results take the form “for every topological space there exists X…” and an X associated to a specific topological space is generally no more pathological than the topological space you started with.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Axiom of Choice</strong></p>
<p>The universe can be very a strange place without choice. One consequence of the Axiom of Choice is that when you partition a set into disjoint nonempty parts, then the number of parts does not exceed the number of elements of the set being partitioned. This can fail without the Axiom of Choice. In fact, if all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable, then it is possible to partition <span class="math inline">\(2^{\omega}\)</span> into <em>more</em> than <span class="math inline">\(2^{\omega}\)</span> many pairwise disjoint nonempty sets!</p>

<section id="answer-3-score-92" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 92)</h4>
<p>Yes, many people continue to fuss about the Axiom of Choice.</p>
<p>At least part of the explanation for why people continue to fuss as they do over the Axiom of Choice is surely the historical fact that there was a period of several decades during which the axiom was not known to be relatively consistent with the other axioms of set theory. It was after all not until 1938 that Goedel proved the relatively consistency of ZFC over ZF, using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_universe">constructible universe</a>, and several more decades passed until Paul Cohen completed the independence proof by proving that ¬AC is also relatively consistent with ZF, using the method of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forcing_%28mathematics%29">forcing</a> in 1962. It was during these intermediate times, and especially the time before 1938 when the axiom was not known to be consistent, that the increasingly bizarre consequences of AC were being discovered, and so the habit naturally developed to pay close attention to when the axiom was used. This habit surely lessened after the independence results, but it was not dropped by everyone. And so today mathematics is populated by large numbers of mathematicians like yourself (and perhaps myself), who freely use AC without worry, and who may even find the possibilities occuring in non-AC situations, such as infinite Dedekind finite sets, to be even weirder than the supposed non-regularities of AC, such as the existence of non-measurable sets.</p>
<p>Yet, even though I largely agree with the feeling you indicate in your question, there is still <em>some</em> reason to pay attention to AC. First, in mathematical situations where one can prove the existence of a mathematical structure without AC, then important consequences often follow concerning the complexity of that structure. An explicit construction, even if more complicated that a pure existence proof from AC, often carries with it computational information concerning the nature of the object constructed, such as whethere it is analytic or Borel or <span class="math inline">\(\Delta^1_2\)</span>, and so on, and these complexity issues can affect other arguments concerning measurability and whatnot. That is, by nature the non-AC constructions are more explicit and these more explicit argument often carry more information.</p>
<p>But second, there remain certain parts of set-theoretic investigation that only make sense in non-AC contexts. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_determinacy">Axiom of Determinacy</a>, for example, stands in contradiction with the Axiom of Choice but nevertheless contains some fascinating, profound mathematical work, pointing to a kind of mathematical paradise, in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, every set has the property of Baire and the perfect set property. This axiom leads to an alternative vision of what set theory could be like. The possibilities of AD place limitations on what we can expect to prove in ZFC, in part because we expect that there are set-theoretic universe close to our own where AD holds. That is, we are interested in AD even if we believe fundamentally in AC, because we can construct the universe L(R), where AD could hold, even if AC holds in the outer universe V. In order to understand L(R), we need to know which theorems we can rely on there, and so we need to know where we used AC.</p>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 198)</h4>
<p>Update: The lecture notes of the CAGA lecture series on perfectoid spaces at the IHES can now be found online, cf. <a href="http://www.ihes.fr/~abbes/CAGA/scholze.html" rel="noreferrer">http://www.ihes.fr/~abbes/CAGA/scholze.html</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that it’s my job to answer this question, so let me just briefly explain everything. A more detailed account will be online soon.</p>
<p>We start with a complete non-archimedean field <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> of mixed characteristic <span class="math inline">\((0,p)\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> has characteristic <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, but its residue field has characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>), equipped with a non-discrete valuation of rank <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, such that (and this is the crucial condition) Frobenius is surjective on <span class="math inline">\(K^+/p\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(K^+\subset K\)</span> is the subring of elements of norm <span class="math inline">\(\leq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some authors, e.g. Gabber-Ramero in their book on Almost ring theory, call such fields deeply ramified (they do not require that they are complete, anyway).</p>
<p>Just think of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> as the completion of the field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}_p(p^{1/p^\infty})\)</span>, or alternatively as the completion of the field <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p^\infty})\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this situation, one can form the field <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>, given as the fraction field of <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime +} = \varprojlim K^+/p\)</span>, where the transition maps are given by Frobenius. Concretely, in the first example it is given by the completion of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F} _p((t^{1/p^\infty}))\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the element <span class="math inline">\((p,p^{\frac 1p},p^{\frac 1{p^2}},\ldots)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime +}=\varprojlim K^+/p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we have the following theorem, due to Fontaine-Wintenberger in the examples I gave, and deduced from the book of Gabber-Ramero in general:</p>
<blockquote>
Theorem: There is a canonical isomorphism of absolute Galois group <span class="math inline">\(G_K\cong G_{K^\prime}\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, it may be instructive to explain this theorem a little, in the example where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the completion of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}_p(p^{1/p^\infty})\)</span> (this assumption will be made whenever examples are discussed). It says that there is a natural equivalence of categories between the category of finite extensions <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and the category of finite extensions <span class="math inline">\(L^\prime\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>. Let us give an example, say <span class="math inline">\(L^\prime\)</span> is given by adjoining a root of <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 7t X + t^5\)</span>. Basically, the idea is that one replaces <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so that one would like to define <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> as the field given by adjoining a root of <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 7p X + p^5\)</span>. However, this is obviously not well-defined: If <span class="math inline">\(p=3\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 7t X + t^5=X^2 - t X + t^5\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 7p X + p^5\neq X^2 - p X + p^5\)</span>, and one will not expect that the fields given by adjoining roots of these different polynomials are the same.</p>
<p>However, there is the following way out: <span class="math inline">\(L^\prime\)</span> can be defined as the splitting field of <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 7t^{1/p^n} X + t^{5/p^n}\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n\geq 0\)</span>, and if we choose <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> very large, then one can see that the fields <span class="math inline">\(L_n\)</span> given as the splitting field of <span class="math inline">\(X^2 - 7p^{1/p^n} X + p^{5/p^n}\)</span> will stabilize as <span class="math inline">\(n\rightarrow \infty\)</span>; this is the desired field <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. Basically, the point is that the discriminant of the polynomials considered becomes very small, and the difference between any two different choices one might make when replacing <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> become comparably small.</p>
<p>This argument can be made precise by using Faltings’s almost mathematics, as developed systematically by Gabber-Ramero. Consider <span class="math inline">\(K\supset K^+\supset \mathfrak{m}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span> is the maximal ideal; in the example, it is the one generated by all <span class="math inline">\(p^{1/p^n}\)</span>, and it satisfies <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}^2 = \mathfrak{m}\)</span>, because the valuation on <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is non-discrete. We have a sequence of localization functors:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span>-mod <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span>-mod / <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>-torsion <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> $K^+ $-mod / <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-power torsion.</p>
<p>The last category is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-mod, and the composition of the two functors is like taking the generic fibre of an object with an integral structure.</p>
<p>In this sense, the category in the middle can be seen as a slightly generic fibre, sitting strictly between an integral structure and an object over the generic fibre. Moreover, an object like <span class="math inline">\(K^+/p\)</span> is nonzero in this middle category, so one can talk about torsion objects, neglecting only very small objects. The official name for this middle category is <span class="math inline">\(K^{+a}\)</span>-mod: almost <span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span>-modules.</p>
<p>This category is an abelian tensor category, and hence one can define in the usual way the notion of a <span class="math inline">\(K^{+a}\)</span>-algebra (= almost <span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span>-algebra), etc. . With some work, one also has notions of almost finitely presented modules and (almost) étale maps. In the following, we will often need the notion of an almost finitely presented étale map, which is the almost analogue of a finite étale cover.</p>
<blockquote>
Theorem (Tate, Gabber-Ramero): If <span class="math inline">\(L/K\)</span> finite extension, then <span class="math inline">\(L^+/K^+\)</span> is almost finitely presented étale. Similarly, if <span class="math inline">\(L^\prime/K^\prime\)</span> finite, then <span class="math inline">\(L^{\prime +}/K^{\prime +}\)</span> is almost finitely presented étale.
</blockquote>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(L^+\)</span> is the valuation subring of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. As an example, assume <span class="math inline">\(p\neq 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L=K(p^\frac 12)\)</span>. For convenience, we look at the situation at a finite level, so let <span class="math inline">\(K_n=\mathbb{Q}_p(p^{1/p^n})\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(L_n=K_n(p^\frac 12)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(L_n^+ = K_n^+[X] / (X^2 - p^{1/p^n})\)</span>. To check whether this is étale, look at <span class="math inline">\(f(X)= X^2 - p^{1/p^n}\)</span> and look at the ideal generated by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and its derivative <span class="math inline">\(f^\prime\)</span>. This contains <span class="math inline">\(p^{1/p^n}\)</span>, so in some sense <span class="math inline">\(L_n^+\)</span> is étale over <span class="math inline">\(K_n^+\)</span> up to <span class="math inline">\(p^{1/p^n}\)</span>-torsion. Now take the limit as <span class="math inline">\(n\rightarrow \infty\)</span> to see that <span class="math inline">\(L^+\)</span> is almost étale over <span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can prove the theorem above:</p>
<p>Finite étale covers of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> = almost finitely presented étale covers of <span class="math inline">\(K^+\)</span> = almost finitely presented étale covers of <span class="math inline">\(K^+/p\)</span> [because (almost) finite étale covers lift uniquely over nilpotents] = almost finitely presented étale covers of <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime +}/t\)</span> [because <span class="math inline">\(K^+/p = K^{\prime +}/t\)</span>, cf. the example] = almost finitely presented étale covers of <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime +}\)</span> = finite étale covers of <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>.</p>
<p>After we understand this theory on the base, we want to generalize to the relative situation. Here, let me make the following claim.</p>
<blockquote>
Claim: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A}^1_{K^\prime}\)</span> “equals” <span class="math inline">\(\varprojlim \mathbb{A}^1_K\)</span>, where the transition maps are the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th power map.

<p>As a first step towards understanding this, let us check this on points. Here it says that <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime = \varprojlim K\)</span>. In particular, there should be map <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\rightarrow K\)</span> by projection to the last coordinate, which I usually denote <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime\mapsto [x^\prime]\)</span> (because it is a related to Teichmüller representatives) and again this can be explained in an example:</p>
<p>Say <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime = t^{-1} + 5 + t^3\)</span>. Basically, we want to replace <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, but this is not well-defined. But we have just learned that this problem becomes less serious as we take <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-power roots. So we look at <span class="math inline">\(t^{-1/p^n} + 5 + t^{3/p^n}\)</span>, replace <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, get <span class="math inline">\(p^{-1/p^n} + 5 + p^{3/p^n}\)</span>, and then we take the <span class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span>-th power again, so that the expression has the chance of being independent of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Now, it is in fact not difficult to see that</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} (p^{-1/p^n} + 5 + p^{3/p^n})^{p^n}\)</span></p>
<p>exists, and this defined <span class="math inline">\([x^\prime]\in K\)</span>. Now the map <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\rightarrow \varprojlim K\)</span> is given by <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime\mapsto ([x^\prime],[x^{\prime 1/p}],[x^{\prime 1/p^2}],\ldots)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to prove that this is a bijection, just note that</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime +} = \varprojlim K^{\prime +}/t^{p^n} = \varprojlim K^{\prime +}/t = \varprojlim K^+/p \leftarrow \varprojlim K^+\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, the last map is the obvious projection, and in fact is a bijection, which amounts to the same verification as that the limit above exists. Afterwards, just invert <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to get the desired identification.</p>
<p>In fact, the good way of approaching this stuff in general is to use some framework of rigid geometry. In the papers of Kedlaya and Liu, where they are doing extremely related stuff, they choose to work with Berkovich spaces; I favor the language of Huber’s adic spaces, as this language is capable of expressing more (e.g., Berkovich only considers rank-<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-valuations, whereas Huber considers also the valuations of higher rank). In the language of adic spaces, the spaces are actually locally ringed topological spaces (equipped with valuations) (and affinoids are open, in contrast to Berkovich’s theory, making it easier to glue), and there is an analytification functor <span class="math inline">\(X\mapsto X^{\mathrm{ad}}\)</span> from schemes of finite type over <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to adic spaces over <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> (similar to the functor associating to a scheme of finite type over <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> a complex-analytic space). Then we have the following theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
Theorem: We have a homeomorphism of underlying topological spaces <span class="math inline">\(|(\mathbb{A}^1_{K^\prime})^{\mathrm{ad}}|\cong \varprojlim |(\mathbb{A}^1_K)^{\mathrm{ad}}|\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, the following question naturally arises: Both sides of this homeomorphism are locally ringed topological spaces: So is it possible to compare the structure sheaves? There is the obvious problem that on the left-hand side, we have characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-rings, whereas on the right-hand side, we have characteristic <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>-rings. How can one possibly pass from one to the other side?</p>
<blockquote>
Definition: A perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra is a complete Banach <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> such that the set of power-bounded elements <span class="math inline">\(R^\circ\subset R\)</span> is open and bounded and Frobenius induces an isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(R^\circ/p^{\frac 1p}\cong R^\circ/p\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, one defines perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>-algebras <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime\)</span>, putting a prime everywhere, and replacing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The last condition is then equivalent to requiring <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime\)</span> perfect, whence the name. Examples are <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, any finite extension <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(K\langle T^{1/p^\infty}\rangle\)</span>, by which I mean: Take the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic completion of <span class="math inline">\(K^+[T^{1/p^\infty}]\)</span>, and then invert <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Recall that in classical rigid geometry, one considers rings like <span class="math inline">\(K\langle T\rangle\)</span>, which is interpreted as the ring of convergent power series on the closed annulus <span class="math inline">\(|x|\leq 1\)</span>. Now in the example of the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{A}^1\)</span> above, we take <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-power roots of the coordinate, so after completion the rings on the inverse limit are in fact perfectoid.</p>
<p>In characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, one can pass from usual affinoid algebras to perfectoid algebras by taking the completed perfection; the difference between the two is small, at least as regards topological information on associated spaces: Frobenius is a homeomorphism on topological spaces, and even on étale topoi. [This is why we don’t have to take <span class="math inline">\(\varprojlim \mathbb{A}^1_{K^\prime}\)</span>: It does not change the topological spaces. In order to compare structure sheaves, one should however take this inverse limit.]</p>
<p>The really exciting theorem is the following, which I call the tilting equivalence:</p>
<blockquote>
Theorem: The category of perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebras and the category of perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>-algebras are equivalent.
</blockquote>
<p>The functor is given by <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime = (\varprojlim R^\circ/p)[t^{-1}]\)</span>. Again, one also has <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime = \varprojlim R\)</span>, where the transition maps are the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th power map, giving also the map <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime\rightarrow R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f^\prime\mapsto [f^\prime]\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are two different proofs for this. One is to write down the inverse functor, given by <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime\mapsto W(R^{\prime \circ})\otimes_{W(K^{\prime +})} K\)</span>, using the map <span class="math inline">\(\theta: W(K^{\prime +})\rightarrow K\)</span> known from <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic Hodge theory. The other proof is similar to what we did above for finite étale covers:</p>
<p>perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebras = almost <span class="math inline">\(K^{+}\)</span>-algebras <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> s.t. <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is flat, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adically complete and Frobenius induces isom <span class="math inline">\(A/p^{1/p}\cong A/p\)</span> = almost <span class="math inline">\(K^+/p\)</span>-algebras <span class="math inline">\(\overline{A}\)</span> s.t. <span class="math inline">\(\overline{A}\)</span> is flat and Frobenius induces isom <span class="math inline">\(\overline{A}/p^{\frac 1p}\cong \overline{A}\)</span>,</p>
<p>and then going over to the other side. Here, the first identification is not difficult; the second relies on the astonishing fact (already in the book by Gabber-Ramero) that the cotangent complex <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{L}_{\overline{A}/(K^+/p)}\)</span> vanishes, and hence one gets unique deformations of objects and morphisms. At least on differentials <span class="math inline">\(\Omega^1\)</span>, one can believe this: Every element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has the form <span class="math inline">\(y^p\)</span> because Frobenius is surjective; but then <span class="math inline">\(dx = dy^p = pdy = 0\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(p=0\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\overline{A}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now let me just briefly summarize the main theorems on the basic nature of perfectoid spaces. First off, an affinoid perfectoid space is associated to an affinoid perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra, which is a pair <span class="math inline">\((R,R^+)\)</span> consisting of a perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> and an open and integrally closed subring <span class="math inline">\(R^+\subset R^\circ\)</span> (it follows that <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m} R^\circ\subset R^+\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(R^+\)</span> is almost equal to <span class="math inline">\(R^\circ\)</span>; in most cases, one will just take <span class="math inline">\(R^+=R^\circ\)</span>). Then also the categories of affinoid perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebras and of affinoid perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K^\prime\)</span>-algebras are equivalent. Huber associates to such pairs <span class="math inline">\((R,R^+)\)</span> a topological spaces <span class="math inline">\(X=\mathrm{Spa}(R,R^+)\)</span> consisting of continuous valuations on <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> that are <span class="math inline">\(\leq 1\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(R^+\)</span>, with the topology generated by the rational subsets <span class="math inline">\(\{x\in X\mid \forall i: |f_i(x)|\leq |g(x)|\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(f_1,\ldots,f_n,g\in R\)</span> generate the unit ideal. Moreover, he defines a structure <em>pre</em>sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>, and the sub<em>pre</em>sheaf <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X^+\)</span>, consisting of functions which have absolute value <span class="math inline">\(\leq 1\)</span> everywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Theorem: Let <span class="math inline">\((R,R^+)\)</span> be an affinoid perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra, with tilt <span class="math inline">\((R^\prime,R^{\prime +})\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(X=\mathrm{Spa}(R,R^+)\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span> etc., and <span class="math inline">\(X^\prime = \mathrm{Spa}(R^\prime,R^{\prime +})\)</span>, etc. . i) We have a canonical homeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(X\cong X^\prime\)</span>, given by mapping <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x^\prime\)</span> defined via <span class="math inline">\(|f^\prime(x^\prime)| = |[f^\prime] (x)|\)</span>. Rational subsets are identified under this homeomorphism. ii) For any rational subset <span class="math inline">\(U\subset X\)</span>, the pair <span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{O}_X(U),\mathcal{O}_X^+(U))\)</span> is affinoid perfectoid with tilt <span class="math inline">\((\mathcal{O}_{X^\prime}(U),\mathcal{O}_{X^\prime}^+(U))\)</span>. iii) The presheaves <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}_X^+\)</span> are sheaves. iv) For all <span class="math inline">\(i&amp;gt;0\)</span>, the cohomology group <span class="math inline">\(H^i(X,\mathcal{O}_X)=0\)</span>; even better, the cohomology group <span class="math inline">\(H^i(X,\mathcal{O}_X^+)\)</span> is almost zero, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\mathfrak{m}\)</span>-torsion.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This allows one to define general perfectoid spaces by gluing affinoid perfectoid spaces. Further, one can define étale morphisms of perfectoid spaces, and then étale topoi. This leads to an improvement on Faltings’s almost purity theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
Theorem: Let <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> be a perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra, and let <span class="math inline">\(S/R\)</span> be finite étale. Then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is perfectoid and <span class="math inline">\(S^\circ\)</span> is almost finitely presented étale over <span class="math inline">\(R^\circ\)</span>.
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, no sort of semistable reduction hypothesis is required anymore. Also, the proof is much easier, cf. the book project by Gabber-Ramero.</p>
<p>Tilting also identifies the étale topoi of a perfectoid space and its tilt, and as an application, one gets the following theorem.</p>
<blockquote>
Theorem: We have an equivalence of étale topoi of adic spaces: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{P}^n_{K^\prime})^{\mathrm{ad}}_{\mathrm{et}}\cong \varprojlim (\mathbb{P}^n_K)^{\mathrm{ad}}_{\mathrm{et}}\)</span>. Here the transition maps are again the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th power map on coordinates.
</blockquote>
<p>Let me end this discussion by mentioning one application. Let <span class="math inline">\(X\subset \mathbb{P}^n_K\)</span> be a smooth hypersurface. By a theorem of Huber, we can find a small open neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{X}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with the same étale cohomology. Moreover, we have the projection <span class="math inline">\(\pi: \mathbb{P}^n_{K^\prime}\rightarrow \mathbb{P}^n_K\)</span>, at least on topological spaces or étale topoi. Within the preimage <span class="math inline">\(\pi^{-1}(\tilde{X})\)</span>, it is possible to find a smooth hypersurface (of possibly much larger degree) <span class="math inline">\(X^\prime\)</span>. This gives a map from the cohomology of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to the cohomology of <span class="math inline">\(X^\prime\)</span>, thereby comparing the étale cohomology of a variety in characteristic <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> with the étale cohomology of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Using this, it is easy to verify the weight-monodromy conjecture for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 52)</h4>
<p>Here is a completely different kind of answer to this question.</p>
<p>A <em>perfectoid space</em> is a term of type <code>PerfectoidSpace</code> in the <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/" rel="noreferrer">Lean theorem prover</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quote from the source code:</p>

CLVRS (&quot;complete locally valued ringed space&quot;) is a category
whose objects are topological spaces with a sheaf of complete topological rings
and an equivalence class of valuation on each stalk, whose support is the unique
maximal ideal of the stalk; in Wedhorn&#39;s notes this category is called 𝒱.
A perfectoid space is an object of CLVRS which is locally isomorphic to Spa(A) with
A a perfectoid ring. Note however that CLVRS is a full subcategory of the category
`PreValuedRingedSpace` of topological spaces equipped with a presheaf of topological
rings and a valuation on each stalk, so the isomorphism can be checked in
PreValuedRingedSpace instead, which is what we do.

<p>The perfectoid space project home page is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, and the source code is <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-perfectoid-spaces" rel="noreferrer">on github</a>. Information for mathematicians on how to read the code above is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/how-to-read-lean.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, and an informal write-up is <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2019/05/11/perfectoid-spaces/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Johan Commelin, Patrick Massot and I are in the process of writing up a more formal document explaining what we had to do to construct this type.</p>
<p>This definition of a perfectoid space is completely mathematically unambiguous. All terms are defined precisely, and if you don’t know what something means then you can right click on it and look at its definition directly, if you compile the software using the Lean theorem prover. Lean is a computer program which checks that definitions and theorems are formally complete and correct. The definitions and theorems have to be written in Lean’s language of course. The definition above says that a perfectoid space is a topological space equipped with the appropriate extra structure (sheaf of complete rings, valuation on stalks etc) and which is covered by spectra of perfectoid rings, and a perfectoid ring is a complete uniform Tate ring with the usual perfectoid property. The main work is developing enough of the theory of completions of topological rings and valuations to put the appropriate structure on the adic spectrum of a Huber pair; in total this was over 10,000 lines of code.</p>
<p>Computer scientists have been developing and using formal proof verification tools for decades. I want to make the slightly contentious statement that 99.9% of the time they are working on statements about the kind of mathematical objects which we teach to undergraduates (groups, graphs, 2-spheres etc). There have been some huge successes in this area (computer-checked proofs of Kepler conjecture, odd order theorem, four colour theorem etc). My impression is that on the whole mathematicians are either unaware of, or not remotely interested in, this work, which for the most part concentrates on proving tricky theorems about “low-level” objects such as finite groups. I have now seen what these systems are capable of and in particular I believe that if <em>mathematicians</em>, rather than computer scientists, start working with formal theorem provers then we can build a database of definitions and statements of theorems which would be far far more interesting to the mathematical community than what the computer scientists have managed to do so far. Tom Hales is leading the <a href="https://jiggerwit.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/formal-abstracts-a-long-term-vision/" rel="noreferrer">Formal Abstracts</a> project which aims to do precisely this. Furthermore, I now believe that theorem provers will inevitably play some role in the future of mathematical research. I am not entirely clear about what this role is yet, but one thing I am 100 percent convinced of is that AI will <em>not</em> be proving hard theorems that humans can’t do, any time soon. However I am equally convinced that computers will soon be helping us to do research – perhaps by giving us powerful targeted search through databases of theorems which humans have claimed to prove, and perhaps in the future pointing out gaps in the mathematical literature, as human mathematicians begin to formalise computer proofs more and more.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 28)</h4>
<p><em>Here’s a much more elementary (and thus incomplete) answer.</em></p>
<p>A rough definition is given in:</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201409/rnoti-p1082.pdf" rel="noreferrer">What Is … a Perfectoid Space?</a>, by Bhargav Bhatt, <em>Notices of the AMS</em> Volume 61, Number 9, October 2014, pp. 1082-1084
</blockquote>
<p>Below I give some motivation.</p>
<p>To start, there is an obvious analogy between the ring of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic integers, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}_p\)</span> and the ring of formal Taylor series over the field with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> elements, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_p[[t]]\)</span> (a ring is an algebraic object like the integers: you can add, subtract, multiply, but not divide). As sets, these are both naturally identified with infinite sequences of integers mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, aka <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_p \cong \mathbf{Z}/(p)\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(p = 2\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}/(2) \cong \{0, 1\}\)</span> (evens and odds), the sequence <span class="math inline">\((1, 1, 1, \ldots)\)</span> corresponds to the 2-adic number <span class="math inline">\(\ldots 111\)</span>, and the formal series <span class="math inline">\(1x^0 + 1x^1 + 1x^2 + \cdots\)</span> (aka, <span class="math inline">\(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots\)</span>). In general, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adic integers are enumerated by <span class="math inline">\(a_0p^0 + a_1p^1 + a_2p^2 + \cdots\)</span> and formal Taylor series mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(a_0t^0 + a_1t^1 + a_2t^2 + \cdots\)</span>, so these correspond (as sets!) by replacing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (or conversely).</p>
<p>Just as obviously, these are different algebraically: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}_p\)</span> has characteristic 0 (if you keep adding 1 to itself finitely many times, you don’t get back to 0), but <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_p[[t]]\)</span> has characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (add 1 to itself <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> times and you get 0). Both are obtained as an inverse limit, respectively of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}/(p^n)\)</span> (integers mod <span class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_p[t]/(t^n)\)</span> (represented by polynomials with coefficients mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and degree below <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>).</p>
<p>These finite steps are very simple objects that require only elementary math to work with. For example <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}/(2^2) \cong \{0, 1, 10, 11\}\)</span> (base 2, so <span class="math inline">\(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)</span> base 10) and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_2[t]/(t^2) \cong \{0, 1, 0 + 1t, 1 + 1t\} = \{0, 1, t, 1 + t\}\)</span>. You can easily play with the arithmetic, for example <span class="math inline">\(11 \cdot 11 = 1001 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\)</span> (base 10: <span class="math inline">\(3^2 = 9 \equiv 1 \pmod 4\)</span>, and corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(3 \equiv -1\)</span>). Similarly, <span class="math inline">\((1 + t) \cdot (1 + t) = 1 + 2t + t^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2, t^2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>You can think of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}_p\)</span> as a “twisted” version of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_p[[t]]\)</span>: at each step, you need to “go around” a factor of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> more times to get back to 0: the characteristic is <span class="math inline">\(p^n\)</span>, so in the limit the characteristic is 0, since you’d need infinitely many steps to get back to 0; while for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{F}_p[[t]]\)</span> the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> means you’re growing independently from the characteristic (in a different direction): the characteristic is always <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. (Forgetting the multiplication, the additive groups are respectively <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}/(p^n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\mathbf{Z}/(p))^n\)</span>: the former are a non-trivial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_extension" rel="noreferrer">group extension</a>, while the latter is just a direct product.)</p>
<p>This suggestive analogy was formalized by Fontaine and Wintenberger in 1979, who showed that if you expand these algebraic objects (allow division (by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), so you get a field, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>th roots), you get objects whose <em>symmetries</em> are <em>naturally</em> identified (the absolute Galois groups are naturally isomorphic). To make the geometry better, you also “fill in the holes” (topologically complete the space, like going from the rationals <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Q}\)</span> to the real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>). Thus it’s analogous steps as going from the ring of integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Z}\)</span> to the field of rationals <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Q}\)</span> to the (topologically) complete field of real numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>, and to the (algebraically) closed field of complex numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{C}\)</span> by including the square root of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> (or fourth root of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if you prefer). (The steps aren’t quite the same: you add roots of unity first, and don’t take the algebraic closure, but same idea.) For a field in characteristic <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> having <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>th roots is equivalent to the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>th power (<span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto x^p\)</span>, aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_endomorphism" rel="noreferrer">Frobenius endomorphism</a>) being 1-to-1 (thus an automorphism, meaning a self-symmetry preserving the algebraic structure), which is equivalent to being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_field" rel="noreferrer">perfect field</a>, hence the name.</p>
<p>Turning to geometry, these two rings (algebraic structures), or rather the fields, correspond geometrically to <em>points</em> (0-dimensional spaces, geometric structures): this is why it’s “algebraic geometry”. You then define a <em>perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebra</em> as a higher-dimensional analogy. In basic algebraic geometry a field <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> corresponds to a point, polynomials <span class="math inline">\(K[x]\)</span> in 1 variable to a line, polynomials <span class="math inline">\(K[x,y]\)</span> in 2 variables to a plane, etc.; same idea here but more technical.</p>
<p>Finally, a <em>perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-space</em> is what you get by gluing together perfectoid <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>-algebras. For example, in basic algebraic geometry you can glue together two lines to get a circle by gluing <span class="math inline">\(x \mapsto 1/x\)</span> (notice that we used a rational function); here “gluing” means “rigid analytic geometry”, and is very technical.</p>
<p>Scholze’s key result is that these spaces (starting either from <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-adics or from formal Taylor series) <em>also</em> correspond to each other naturally (the categories are identified and preserve the topology) …and that this clarifies many existing results and proves new ones.</p>

<h3>76: Consequences of the Riemann hypothesis (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/17209.html">44372</a> in 2015)</h3>
<section id="question-75" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I assume a number of results have been proven conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis, of course in number theory and maybe in other fields. What are the most relevant you know?</p>
<p>It would also be nice to include consequences of the generalized Riemann hypothesis (but specify which one is assumed).</p>

<p>I gave a talk on this topic a few months ago, so I assembled a list then which could be appreciated by a general mathematical audience. I’ll reproduce it here.</p>
<p>Let’s start with three applications of RH for the Riemann zeta-function only.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Sharp estimates on the remainder term in the prime number theorem: <span class="math inline">\(\pi(x) = {\text{Li}}(x) + O(\sqrt{x}\log x)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\({\text{Li}}(x)\)</span> is the logarithmic integral (the integral from 2 to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(1/\log t\)</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Comparing <span class="math inline">\(\pi(x)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\text{Li}}(x)\)</span>. All the numerical data shows <span class="math inline">\(\pi(x)\)</span> &lt; <span class="math inline">\({\text{Li}}(x)\)</span>, and Gauss thought this was always true, but in 1914 Littlewood used the Riemann hypothesis to show the inequality reverses infinitely often. In 1933, Skewes used RH to show the inequality reverses for some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> below 10<sup>10</sup>10^34. In 1955 Skewes unconditionally (no need for RH) showed the inequality reverses for some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> below 10<sup>10</sup>10^963. Maybe this was the first example where something was proved first assuming RH and later proved unconditionally.
</p></li>
<li>Gaps between primes. In 1919, Cramer showed RH implies <span class="math inline">\(p_{k+1} - p_k = O(\sqrt{p_k}\log p_k)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p_k\)</span> is the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>th prime. (A conjecture of Legendre is that there’s always a prime between <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((n+1)^2\)</span> – in fact there should be <em>a lot</em> of them – and this would imply <span class="math inline">\(p_{k+1} - p_k = O(\sqrt{p_k})\)</span>. This is better than Cramer’s result, so it lies deeper than a consequence of RH. Cramer also conjectured that the gap is really <span class="math inline">\(O((\log p_k)^2)\)</span>.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s move on to applications involving more zeta and <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions than just the Riemann zeta-function. Note that typically we will need to assume GRH for infinitely many such functions to say anything.</p>
<p>
<ol start="4" type="a">
<li>Chebyshev’s conjecture. In 1853, Chebyshev tabulated the primes which are <span class="math inline">\(1 \bmod 4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(3 \bmod 4\)</span> and noticed there are always at least as many <span class="math inline">\(3 \bmod 4\)</span> primes up to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(1 \bmod 4\)</span> primes. He conjectured this was always true and also gave an analytic sense in which there are more <span class="math inline">\(3 \bmod 4\)</span> primes: <span class="math display">\[
\lim_{x \rightarrow 1^{-}} \sum_{p \not= 2} (-1)^{(p+1)/2}x^p = \infty.
\]</span> Here the sum runs over odd primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. In 1917, Hardy-Littlewood and Landau (independently) showed this second conjecture of Chebyshev’s is equivalent to GRH for the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function of the nontrivial character mod 4. (In 1994, Rubinstein and Sarnak used simplicity and linear independence hypotheses on zeros of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions to say something about Chebyshev’s first conjecture, but as the posted question asked only about consequences of RH and GRH, I leave the matter there and move on.)
</p></li>
<li>The Goldbach conjecture (1742). The “even” version says all even integers <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 4\)</span> are a sum of 2 primes, while the “odd” version says all odd integers <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 7\)</span> are a sum of 3 primes. For most mathematicians, the Goldbach conjecture is understood to mean the even version, and obviously the even version implies the odd version. There has been progress on the odd version if we assume GRH. In 1923, assuming all Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions are nonzero in a right half-plane <span class="math inline">\({\text{Re}}(s) \geq 3/4 - \varepsilon\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is fixed (independent of the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function), Hardy and Littlewood showed the odd Goldbach conjecture is true for all sufficiently large odd <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. In 1937, Vinogradov proved the same result unconditionally, so he was able to remove GRH as a hypothesis. In 1997, Deshouillers, Effinger, te Riele, and Zinoviev showed the odd Goldbach conjecture is true for all odd <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 7\)</span> assuming GRH. That is, the odd Goldbach conjecture is completely settled if GRH is true.</li>
</ol>
<p>Update: This is now an obsolete application of GRH since the odd Goldbach Conjecture was unconditionally proved by Harald Helfgott in 2013.</p>
<ol start="6" type="a">
<li>Polynomial-time primality tests. By results of Ankeny (1952) and Montgomery (1971), if GRH is true for <em>all</em> Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions then the first nonmember of a proper subgroup of any unit group <span class="math inline">\(({\mathbf Z}/m{\mathbf Z})^\times\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O((\log m)^2)\)</span>, where the <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>-constant is independent of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. In 1985, Bach showed under GRH that you take the constant to be 2. That is, each proper subgroup of <span class="math inline">\(({\mathbf Z}/m{\mathbf Z})^\times\)</span> does not contain some integer from 1 to <span class="math inline">\(2(\log m)^2\)</span>. Put differently, if a subgroup contains all positive integers below <span class="math inline">\(2(\log m)^2\)</span> then the subgroup is the whole unit group mod <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. (If instead we knew <em>all</em> Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions have no nontrivial zeros on <span class="math inline">\({\text{Re}}(s) &amp;gt; 1 - \varepsilon\)</span> then the first nonmember of any proper subgroup is <span class="math inline">\(O((\log m)^{1/\varepsilon})\)</span>. Set <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon = 1/2\)</span> to get the previous result I stated using GRH.) In 1976, Gary Miller used such results to show on GRH for <em>all</em> Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions that there is a polynomial-time primality test. (It involved deciding if a subgroup of units is proper or not.) Shortly afterwards Solovay and Strassen described a different test along these lines using Jacobi symbols which only involved subgroups containing <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, so their test would “only” need GRH for Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions of even characters in order to be a polynomial-time primality test. (Solovay and Strassen described their test only as a probabilistic test.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2002 Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena gave an unconditional polynomial-time primality test. This is a nice example showing how GRH guides mathematicians in the direction of what should be true and then you hope to find a proof of those results by other (unconditional) methods.</p>
<ol start="7" type="a">
<li>Euclidean rings of integers. In 1973, Weinberger showed that if GRH is true for Dedekind zeta-functions then any number field with an infinite unit group (so ignoring the rationals and imaginary quadratic fields) is Euclidean if it has class number 1. As a special case, in concrete terms, if <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is a positive integer which is not a perfect square then the ring <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf Z}[\sqrt{d}]\)</span> is a unique factorization domain only if it is Euclidean. There has been progress in the direction of unconditional proofs that class number 1 implies Euclidean by Ram Murty and others, but as a striking special case let’s consider <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf Z}[\sqrt{14}]\)</span>. It has class number 1 (which must have been known to Gauss in the early 19th century, in the language of quadratic forms), so it should be Euclidean. This particular real quadratic ring was first proved to be Euclidean only in 2004 (by M. Harper). So this is a ring which was known to have unique factorization for over 100 years before it was proved to be Euclidean.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<ol start="8" type="a">
<li>Artin’s primitive root conjecture. In 1927, Artin conjectured that any integer <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> which is not <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> or a perfect square is a generator of <span class="math inline">\(({\mathbf Z}/p{\mathbf Z})^\times\)</span> for infinitely many <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, in fact for a positive proportion of such <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. As a special case, taking <span class="math inline">\(a = 10\)</span>, this says for primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the unit fraction <span class="math inline">\(1/p\)</span> has decimal period <span class="math inline">\(p-1\)</span> for a positive proportion of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. (For any prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the decimal period for <span class="math inline">\(1/p\)</span> is a factor of <span class="math inline">\(p-1\)</span>, so this special case is saying the largest possible choice is realized infinitely often in a precise sense; a weaker version of this special case goes back to Gauss.) In 1967, Hooley showed Artin’s conjecture follows from GRH. In 1984, R. Murty and Gupta showed unconditionally that the conjecture is true for infinitely many <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, but the proof couldn’t pin down a specific <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> for which it is true, and in 1986 Heath-Brown showed the conjecture is true for all prime values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with at most two exceptions (and surely there are no exceptions). No definite <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is known for which Artin’s conjecture is unconditionally true.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
<ol type="i">
<li>First prime in an arithmetic progression. If <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(a,m) = 1\)</span> then there are infinitely many primes <span class="math inline">\(p \equiv a \bmod m\)</span>. When does the first one appear, as a function of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>? In 1934, assuming GRH Chowla showed the first prime <span class="math inline">\(p \equiv a \bmod m\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(O(m^2(\log m)^2)\)</span>. In 1944, Linnik unconditionally showed the bound is <span class="math inline">\(O(m^L)\)</span> for some universal exponent <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>. The latest unconditional choice for <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> (Xylouris, 2009) is <span class="math inline">\(L = 5.2\)</span>.

<ol start="10" type="a">
<li>Gauss’ class number problem. Gauss (1801) conjectured in the language of quadratic forms that there are only finitely many imaginary quadratic fields with class number 1. (He actually conjectured more precisely that the 9 known examples are the only ones, but for what I want to say the weaker finiteness statement is simpler.) In 1913, Gronwall showed this is true if the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions of all imaginary quadratic Dirichlet characters have no zeros in some common strip <span class="math inline">\(1- \varepsilon &amp;lt; {\text{Re}}(s) &amp;lt; 1\)</span>. That is weaker than GRH (we only care about <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions of a restricted collection of characters), but it is still an unproved condition. In 1933, Deuring and Mordell showed Gauss’ conjecture is true if the ordinary RH (for Riemann zeta-function) is <em>false</em>, and then in 1934 Heilbronn showed Gauss’ conjecture is true if GRH is <em>false</em> for some Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-function of an imaginary quadratic character. Since Gronwall proved Gauss’ conjecture is true when GRH is true for the Riemann zeta-function and the Dirichlet <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions of all imaginary quadratic Dirichlet characters and Deuring–Mordell–Heilbronn proved Gauss’ conjecture is true when GRH is false for at least one of those functions, Gauss’ conjecture is true by baby logic. In 1935, Siegel proved Gauss’ conjecture is true unconditionally, and in the 1950s and 1960s Baker, Heegner, and Stark gave separate unconditional proofs of Gauss’ precise “only 9” conjecture.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<ol start="11" type="a">
<li>Missing values of a quadratic form. Lagrange (1772) showed every positive integer is a sum of four squares. However, not every integer is a sum of three squares: <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\)</span> misses all <span class="math inline">\(n \equiv 7 \bmod 8\)</span>. Legendre (1798) showed a positive integer is a sum of three squares iff it is <em>not</em> of the form <span class="math inline">\(4^a(8k+7)\)</span>. This can be phrased as a local-global problem: <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = n\)</span> is solvable in integers iff the congruence <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \equiv n \bmod m\)</span> is solvable for all <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. More generally, the same local-global phenomenon applies to the three-variable quadratic form <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 + cz^2\)</span> for all integers <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> from 2 to 10 <em>except</em> <span class="math inline">\(c = 7\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c = 10\)</span>. What happens for these two special values? Ramanujan looked at <span class="math inline">\(c = 10\)</span>. He found 16 values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which there is local solvability (that is, we can solve <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 + 10z^2 \equiv n \bmod m\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) but not global solvability (no integral solution for <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + y^2 + 10z^2 = n\)</span>). Two additional values of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> were found later, and in 1990 Duke and Schulze-Pillot showed that local solvability implies global solvability except for (ineffectively) finitely many positive integers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. In 1997, Ono and Soundararajan showed that, under GRH, the 18 known exceptions are the only ones.
</p></li>
<li>Euler’s convenient numbers. Euler called an integer <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> <em>convenient</em> if any odd integer greater than 1 that has a unique representation as <span class="math inline">\(x^2 + ny^2\)</span> in positive integers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and which moreover has <span class="math inline">\((x,ny) = 1\)</span>, is a prime number. (These numbers were convenient for Euler to use to prove certain numbers that were large in his day, like <span class="math inline">\(67579 = 229^2 + 2\cdot 87^2\)</span>, are prime.) Euler found 65 convenient numbers below 10000 (the last one being 1848). In 1934, Chowla showed there are finitely many convenient numbers. In 1973, Weinberger showed there is at most one convenient number not in Euler’s list, and if the <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>-functions of all quadratic Dirichlet characters satisfy GRH then Euler’s list is complete. What he needed from GRH is the lack of any real zeros in the interval <span class="math inline">\((53/54,1)\)</span>.</li>

<h3>77: Cool problems to impress students with group theory (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/13320.html">44072</a> in 2010)</h3>
<section id="question-76" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Since this forum is densely populated with algebraists, I think I’ll ask it here.</p>
<p>I’m teaching intermediate level algebra this semester and I’d like to entertain my students with some clever applications of group theory. So, I’m looking for problems satisfying the following 4 conditions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It should be stated in the language having nothing whatsoever to do with groups/rings/other algebraic notions.</p></li>
<li><p>It should have a slick easy to explain (but not necessarily easy to guess) solution using finite (preferrably non-abelian) groups.</p></li>
<li><p>It shouldn’t have an obvious alternative elementary solution (non-obvious alternative elementary solutions are OK).</p></li>
<li><p>It should look “cute” to an average student (or, at least, to a person who is curious about mathematics but has no formal education).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An example I know that, in my opinion, satisfies all 4 conditions is the problem of tiling a given region with given polyomino (with the solution that the boundary word should be the identity element for the tiling to be possible and various examples when it is not but the trivial area considerations and standard colorings do not show it immediately)</p>
<p>I’m making it community wiki but, of course, you are more than welcome to submit more than one problem per post.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>In the TV show “Futurama”, there’s an episode named “The Prisoner of Benda” in which two of the characters swap bodies using a machine with a fundamental flaw: no two people can use it to swap bodies twice. This means they can’t simply use the machine again to swap back.</p>
<p>They spend the rest of the episode trying to return to their original bodies. Eventually, a scientist (who also happens to be a Harlem globetrotter) figures out how to help them using group theory.</p>
<p>With a little reflection, one can see that this problem can be recast into one about the symmetric group.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 54)</h4>
<p>Here is a striking application of a particular finite non-abelian group.</p>
<p>Explain to your students the issue of check digits as an error-detecting device on credit cards, automobile identification numbers, etc. Two common errors in communicating strings of numbers is a single-digit error (…372… –&gt; …382…) or an adjacent transposition error (…32… —&gt; …23…). We want to design a check digit protocol in such a way that these two common errors are both detected (though not necessarily corrected: an error sign may flash in practice and the person is just prompted to enter the numbers all over again). The simplest check digit protocol uses modular arithmetic, as follows.</p>
<p>If we have an alphabet of m symbols and we agree that our strings of symbols to be used all have n terms, say they are written as a_1a_2…a_n, introduce a set of weights w_1,…,w_n and a valid string is one where</p>
<p>w_1a_1 + … + w_na_n = 0 mod m.</p>
<p>In practice we take w_n = 1 or -1 and the <em>unique</em> choice of a_n that fits the congruence given all the other data is the check digit.</p>
<p>Theorem 1: All single digit errors are caught iff (w_i,m) = 1 for all i.</p>
<p>That means if a valid string – one satisfying the above congruence – has a single term changed then the result will not satisfy the congruence and thus the error is detected.</p>
<p>Theorem 2: All adjacent transposition errors are caught iff (w_{i+1}-w_i,m) = 1 for all i. (Wrap around when i = n.)</p>
<p>For example, say m = 10 (using the symbols 0,1,2,…,9). If all single digit errors are caught then each w_i has to be taken from {1,3,5,7}, but the difference of any two of these is even, so Theorem 2 won’t apply.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that &quot;no check digit protocol exists on Z/10 (for strings of length greater than 1) which detects all single digit errors and all adjacent transposition errors.</p>
<p>Maybe you think we are just not being clever enough in our check digit protocol mod 10. For example, instead of those scaling operations a |—&gt; w_ia which are put together by addition, we could just define in some other way a set of permutations s_i of Z/m and declare a string a_1….a_n to be valid when</p>
<p>s_1(a_1) + … + s_n(a_n) = 0 mod m.</p>
<p>We can use this congruence to solve for a_n given everything else, so we can make check digits this way too.</p>
<p>Theorem 3. When m = 10, or more generally when m is even, there is an adjacent transposition error – and in fact a transposition error in any two predetermined positions for some string – that won’t be caught.</p>
<p>The proof is a clever argument by contradiction, but I won’t type up the details here.</p>
<p>Since in practice we’d like to use 10 digits (or 26 letters – still even) for codes, Theorem 3 is annoying. The book community with their ISBN code got around this by using m = 11 with a special check digit of X (a few years ago they switched to m = 13). It is natural to ask: is there some check digit protocol on 10 symbols?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, using the group D_5 (non-abelian of order 10) in place of Z/10.</p>
<p>This was found by Verhoeff in 1969. It has hardly been adopted anywhere, due to inertia perhaps, even though the mechanism of it would in practice always be hidden in computer code so the user wouldn’t really need to know such brain-busting group theory like D_5.</p>
<p>You can read about this by looking at</p>
<p>S. J. Winters, Error Detecting Schemes Using Dihedral Groups, The UMAP Journal 11 (1990), 299–308.</p>
<p>The only bad thing about this article by Winters is the funny use of the word scheme, e.g., the third section of the article is called (I am not making this up) “Dihedral Group Schemes”. I recommend using the word “protocol” in place of “scheme” for this check digit business since it it more mathematically neutral.</p>
<p>By the way, Theorem 3 should not be construed as suggesting there is <em>no</em> method of using Z/10 to develop a check digit protocol which detects both of the two errors I’m discussing here. See, for example,</p>
<p>K. A. S. Abdel-Ghaffar, Detecting Substitutions and Transpositions of Characters, The Computer Journal 41 (1998) 270–277.</p>
<p>Section 3.4 is the part which applies to modulus 10. I have not read the paper in detail (since I’m personally not interested enough in it), but the end of the introduction is amusing. After describing what he will be able to do he says his method “is easier to understand compared to the construction based on dihedral groups”. What the heck is so hard about dihedral groups? Sheesh.</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 53)</h4>
<p>Mattress Turning! Don’t say it’s not ‘cute’!</p>
<p>The set of sensible orientations of your mattress on a bed (probably) has 4 elements. If your mattress is prone to sagging due to the weight of its users then you need to periodically turn it into another one of the 4 configurations. It’d be nice if there were a simple operation you could perform on the mattress once a month, say.</p>
<p>Now comes the group theory: the 4 element group of configurations is the Klein viergruppe, not a cyclic group. So you can’t find one transformation that you can repeat to get all configurations. You need to have a more complex procedure where the transformation varies from month to month.</p>
<p>It gets harder, of course, if you have a cubical mattress. See <a href="http://bit-player.org/wp-content/extras/bph-publications/AmSci-2005-09-Hayes-mattress.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Group Theory in the Bedroom</a> for more information.</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 23)</h4>
<p>
Anyone that thrusts baby Rudin - as so many departments do, sadly, in an act of either callous indifference or elitist zealotism - on beginning analysis students with no prior experience with rigor is committing an act of inhumanity against a fellow human being. Let’s face it: Calculus just ain’t what it used to be and Rudin is going to be a buzz-kill for any but the best students. I personally have never liked Rudin even for good students. Rudin seems more interested in showing how clever he is then actually teaching students analysis. <br> My recommended texts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For average students,who have never seen proofs before, I strongly recommend <strong>Ross’ <em>Elementary Analysis:The Theory Of Calculus.</em></strong> <br> It’s gentle, complete and walks the reader through a careful presentation of calculus containing many steps that are usually omitted or left as an exercise. It can also be used for an honors calculus course: I’ve had friends that have used it for that purpose with great success. <strong>Spivak</strong> is a beautiful book at roughly the same level that’ll work just as well.
</li>
<li>
More advanced, but I think well worth the effort, is <strong>Kenneth Hoffman’s <em>Analysis In Euclidean Space</em></strong>, which I reviewed for the MAA online a few months ago when Dover reissued it. <br> It’s an amazingly deep and complete text on normed linear spaces rather then metric or topological spaces and focuses on WHY things work in analysis as they do. This is the kind of book EVERYONE can learn something from and now that it’s in Dover,there’s no reason not to have it.
</li>
<li>
Lastly, for honor students on their way to elite PHD programs, we now have a wonderful alternative to Rudin and I’m shocked no one’s mentioned it at this thread yet: <strong>Charles Chapman Pugh’s <em>Real Mathematical Analysis</em></strong>, which developed out of the author’s honors analysis courses at Berkeley.<br> It’s terse but written with crystal clarity and with hundreds of well-chosen pictures and hard exercises. Pugh has a real gift that’s on display here. He knows exactly how many words it takes to clearly explain a concept-NOT ONE WORD MORE AND NOT ONE WORD LESS. I’ve never seen any author who does this as effectively as Pugh. The many, many pictures greatly assist him in this task: all of them serve some purpose, none are throwaways just to fill space. Even if it’s just to make a joke(see the cornball pic in chapter one showing a Dedekind cut,ugh).<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oh, almost forgot my personal favorite: <strong>Steven Krantz’s <em>Real Analysis And Foundations</em></strong>. If I was ordered to teach real analysis tomorrow, this is probably the book I’d choose, supplemented with Hoffman. Krantz is one of our foremost teachers and textbook authors and he does a fantastic job here giving the student a slow build-up to Rudin-level and containing many topics not included in most courses, such as wavelets and applications to differential equations. What’s most impressive about the book is how it slowly builds in difficulty. The early chapters are gentle, but as the book progresses, the presentation and exercises become steadily more sophisticated. By the last chapter, the presentation is a lot like Rudin’s. I would strongly consider this text if I was trying for self study. <br><br> Anyhow, those are my picks.

<p>Look no further than Spivak’s completely amazing <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JKVu_9InRUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=spivak%20calculus&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">Calculus</a>. I have taught analysis courses from this book many times and learned many things in the process. One example is the wonderful “peak points” proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. The exercises are really good too.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<p>For correlation measurement betweeen 2 variables, I use Pearson formula.</p>
<p>What formula can use to find degree of correlation between 3 variables ? My variabes are not symmetric: The correlation in question is between 1st variable and pair of the other two. But I don’t have a formula to combine 2nd and 3rd into one variable. Variables have values -1, 0, 1, if it matters.</p>

<p>
Maybe you need the theory of cumulants also called semi-invariants. For two random variables <span class="math inline">\(X,Y\)</span> the correlation (or second cumulant) is <span class="math inline">\(v(X,Y)=E(XY)-E(X)E(Y)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> denotes the expectation. Pearson’s formula makes a dimensionless quantity <span class="math display">\[r=\frac{v(X,Y)}{\sqrt{v(X,X) v(Y,Y)}}\ ,\]</span> i.e., <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> might have units like centimeters but <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a pure number. The third cumulant generalizes <span class="math inline">\(v(X,Y)\)</span> and measures a correlation of three variables `altogether’, i.e., not indirectly resulting from their pairwise correlations. It is <span class="math display">\[
c(X,Y,Z)=E(XYZ)-E(X)E(YZ)-E(Y)E(XZ)-E(Z)E(XY)
\]</span> <span class="math display">\[
+2E(X)E(Y)E(Z).
\]</span> However I don’t know what the natural or standard dimensionless analog of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> would be. A possibility is <span class="math display">\[
\frac{c(X,Y,Z)}{\sqrt{v(X,X)v(Y,Y)v(Z,Z)}}.
\]</span> All this is about random variables, say discrete given by a finite sample <span class="math inline">\((x_i,y_i,z_i)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(1\le i\le N\)</span>. Now in statistical estimation you might have things like <span class="math inline">\(1/N\)</span> turning into <span class="math inline">\(1/(N-1)\)</span> in the correct formulas to use.

<h4>Answer 2 (score 2)</h4>
<p>I understand the question like the following example. First we consider the correlation of two variables, say age and income of professionals, and expect, that higher age agrees with higher income. Surely we have cases, where this is inverted: older professionals with lower income and/or younger professional with higher income.</p>
<p>Then we look at a third variable for instance political/ethical acceptance for that professional by other people, and may assume, that high ethical acceptance is high if age/income agree and acceptance is low if age/income disagree.</p>
<p>If such a constellation is asked for, then I would go back to the data and not to the aggregate’s parameters. After z-standardizing of <em>income</em> and <em>age</em> I would construct an income/age-agree index <em>agi</em> by multiplying <em>agi = z(income) x z(age)</em> on case level. Then <em>agi</em> has high positive values if either <em>age</em> and <em>income</em> are high positive or if they both are high negative. Then I would correlate <em>z(agi)</em> with <em>z(acceptance)</em>.</p>

<p>Quote from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3961" rel="noreferrer">arxiv.org/abs/0902.3961</a>, Bjorn Poonen, Feb. 2009: “Harvey Friedman asked whether there exists a polynomial <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\in Q[x,y]\)</span></span> such that the induced map <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(Q × Q\to Q\)</span></span> is injective. Heuristics suggest that most sufficiently complicated polynomials should do the trick. Don Zagier has speculated that a polynomial as simple as <span class="math-container"><span class="math inline">\(x^7+3y^7\)</span></span> might already be an example. But it seems very difficult to prove that any polynomial works. Our theorem gives a positive answer conditional on a small part of a well-known conjecture.” – Jonas Meyer</p>

<section id="question-81" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>You’re hanging out with a bunch of other mathematicians - you go out to dinner, you’re on the train, you’re at a department tea, et cetera. Someone says something like “A group of 100 people at a party are each receive hats with different prime numbers and …” For the next few minutes everyone has fun solving the problem together.</p>
<p>I love puzzles like that. But there’s a problem – I running into the same puzzles over and over. But there must be lots of great problems I’ve never run into. So I’d like to hear problems that other people have enjoyed, and hopefully everyone will learn some new ones.</p>
<p>So: What are your favorite dinner conversation math puzzles?</p>
<p>I don’t want to provide hard guidelines. But I’m generally interested in problems that are mathematical and not just logic puzzles. They shouldn’t require written calculations or a convoluted answer. And they should be fun - with some sort of cute step, aha moment, or other satisfying twist. I’d prefer to keep things pretty elementary, but a cool problem requiring a little background is a-okay.</p>
<p>One problem per answer.</p>
<p>If you post the answer, please obfuscate it with something like <a href="http://www.rot13.com/">rot13</a>. Don’t spoil the fun for everyone else.</p>

<p>&quot;There is an island upon which a tribe resides. The tribe consists of 1000 people, with various eye colours. Yet, their religion forbids them to know their own eye color, or even to discuss the topic; thus, each resident can (and does) see the eye colors of all other residents, but has no way of discovering his or her own (there are no reflective surfaces). If a tribesperson does discover his or her own eye color, then their religion compels them to commit ritual suicide at noon the following day in the village square for all to witness. All the tribespeople are highly logical and devout, and they all know that each other is also highly logical and devout (and they all know that they all know that each other is highly logical and devout, and so forth).</p>
<p>Of the 1000 islanders, it turns out that 100 of them have blue eyes and 900 of them have brown eyes, although the islanders are not initially aware of these statistics (each of them can of course only see 999 of the 1000 tribespeople).</p>
<p>One day, a blue-eyed foreigner visits to the island and wins the complete trust of the tribe.</p>
<p>One evening, he addresses the entire tribe to thank them for their hospitality.</p>
<p>However, not knowing the customs, the foreigner makes the mistake of mentioning eye color in his address, remarking “how unusual it is to see another blue-eyed person like myself in this region of the world”.</p>
<p>What effect, if anything, does this faux pas have on the tribe?&quot;</p>
<p>For those of you interested, there is a huge discussion of the problem at <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/the-blue-eyed-islanders-puzzle/</a></p>

<p>You and infinitely many other people are wearing hats. Each hat is either red or blue. Every person can see every other person’s hat color, but cannot see his/her own hat color; aside from that, you cannot share any information (but you are allowed to agree on a strategy before any of the hats appear on your heads). Everybody simultaneously guesses the color of his/her hat. You win if all but finitely many of you are right. Find a strategy so that you always win.</p>

<p>You are blindfolded, then given a deck of cards in which 23 of the cards have been flipped up, then inserted into the deck randomly (you know this). Without taking the blindfold off, rearrange the deck into two stacks such that both stacks have the same number of up-flipped cards. (You are allowed to flip as many cards as you please.)</p>

<p>What is the difference between</p>

<p>My understanding is:</p>

<p><strong>complete</strong>: same as strongly connected.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Connected</em> is usually associated with undirected graphs (two way edges): there is a <strong>path</strong> between every two nodes.
</li>
<li>
<em>Strongly connected</em> is usually associated with directed graphs (one way edges): there is a <strong>route</strong> between every two nodes.
</li>
<li>
<em>Complete graphs</em> are undirected graphs where there is an <strong>edge</strong> between every pair of nodes.

<h4>Answer 2 (score 3)</h4>
<p>It is also important to remember the distinction between strongly connected and unilaterally connected. A directed graph is unilaterally connected if for any two vertices a and b, there is a directed path from a to b or from b to a but not necessarily both (although there could be). Strongly connected implies that both directed paths exist. This means that strongly connected graphs are a subset of unilaterally connected graphs.</p>
<p>And a directed graph is weakly connected if it’s underlying graph is connected.</p>

<h3>84: Advice for pure-math Phd students (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/152987.html">39567</a> in 2013)</h3>
<section id="question-83" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Pursuing a Phd in pure math can be a daunting task. A number of students who begin a Phd in pure math don’t complete it, and there are high-quality dissertations and those which are not so high quality.</p>
<p>My question is: <em>What advice do you, or would you, give beginning or first-year Phd students early in their studies which will likely increase their possibility of successfully completing a high-quality Phd in pure math</em>? Alternatively: <em>What advice do you wish you were given when you started your Phd</em>?</p>
<p><em>Are there particular qualities or habits, or is there a particular way of approaching or attitude towards Phd studies, shown by Phd students who complete a high-quality Phd in pure math compared to those who don’t</em>?</p>
<p><em>Is there general principles or advice which can be given to “fit all”? Or do those students who successfully complete a pure-math Phd have “wildly-varying” styles, attitudes and approaches to their studies</em>?</p>
<p>I guess another perspective on this would be: <em>What have you found to be the main reasons for Phd students dropping out or completing a poor-quality pure-math Phd, and what advice could have been given to them early in their studies to prevent these reasons from occuring</em>?</p>
<p>I ask this question because I noticed in my department this year that some pure-math Phd students dropped out in their second or third year of study for various reasons, most of which seemed preventable if they had the right advice early on from their supervisors. Also, the qualities required by pure-math Phd students seem in some ways to be unique compared to other fields. Finally, is it fair to say that professors/supervisors are sometimes not particularly skilled at giving this kind of advice, so many (most?) Phd students are “going without” advice that could really benefit them?</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-32-1" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 32)</h4>
<p>The first piece of advice I give all of my students is to have a plan B if the math thing does not work out. There is nothing more pitiful than a person who is trying to hold on to a bad job in academia because they somehow have it in their head that this is the only honorable option out there.</p>
<p>It is hard to generalize, but another important thing is to talk to many people. Yes, one needs to learn stuff from books and papers, but mathematics these days is not a solitary occupation and one will not get far by only talking to their advisor. It is, however, crucial to be able to have a good working relationship with the advisor, in fact this should be the criterion for the choice of the advisor.</p>
<p>Sometimes students are just not strong enough or get unlucky with the choice of thesis problem or advisor. Such is life.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2-score-14-1" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 14)</h4>
<p>From my personal experience (I am currently in my third year of my PHD), I find that the most valuable thing an advisor can provide is simply insisting that you keep working on your problem. Solving mathematical problems is tough, and your first one even more so. After getting a “result” (it was wrong) fairly quickly after getting my problem and quickly finding out that it was incorrect, I worked essentially fruitlessly at my problem for over a year. This was after dredging through dozens of papers relating to the topic. Many times I felt like I should mention to my advisor that perhaps this problem is not suitable and that I should work on something else. He never waivered, and gently insisted that I keep working. Finally this past summer I was able to make non-trivial progress, albeit not quite in the direction originally anticipated.</p>
<p>In turn, the advice I offer is as follows: there is no replacement for hardwork and perseverance. The return on investment (in terms of monetary value) of a pure math PHD is fairly poor; you can earn a lot more money doing a lot less in many other professions. If the intrinsic value and personal satisfaction of the work is not enough and you are doing it for the money, then start coming up with a plan B. However, if you would rather hammer away at your problem all day than do anything else, then be prepared to work hard often.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that the role of your advisor is to advise, not to do the work for you. It is important to remember that the key transformation to be undertaken during your PHD is the transition from apprentice to master. After the completion of your PHD you will no longer be your advisor’s disciple but your own master, where you will presumably start an academic career where you will primarily fill an instructor or mentorship role. Thus I feel you should expect to go beyond the boundaries naturally set out by your advisor; indeed, it is important for you to be better than your advisor at something (mathematically). If your advisor is a strict upper bound of you in every mathematical aspect, then why should you get a job since presumably your advisor can always do it better than you? So, it is important to work hard on your problem and get good results, but always be mindful of other subject areas, especially if your techniques can be applied to said subject areas.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-3-score-10" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 10)</h4>
<p>There are a few things regarding that:</p>
<p>In the first year attend a wide variety of graduate courses in Math for two reasons: first, get acquainted with the wide variety of areas to figure out what area of Math speaks to you most, and second, gear which professors you would like to work with. IMHO professors’ research abilities and advising abilities are less correlated that their graduate level teaching abilities and advising abilities.</p>
<p>Attend colloquia not only in Math but also in related areas, such as Physics, Computer Science, Engineering, etc. A huge part of successful Ph.D. is the problem statement. Interesting mathematical problems may arise not only in Math but also in applications. An additional benefit is some exposure to application of Math in case the career in pure Math wouldn’t work out.</p>
<p>Pick the best advisor you can, based not only on their track record in Math, but also in their availability, ability to find interesting connections, communicate clearly, and foremost pose interesting problems. Make sure you start working with an advisor in your 2nd year the latest.</p>
<p>Make sure you can devote 3-4 years to your PhD study; in particular, you are comfortable enough with the finances not to seek a job outside the university before the completion of your program.</p>
<p>Have a plan B that is not too far away from plan A. For example, if you decide to do research in Stochastic Processes get familiar with Economics; if you pursue research in Discrete Math learn how to program and perhaps minor in Computer Science, etc. Then if life requirements would turn you away from academia you would still be valuable in an industry that requires substantial Math skills. Moreover, you may be able to do the Math you love in that industry, which would bring you twice as much money, but, alas, no peer recognition… If you are doing Math for the love of Math rather than recognition a career in an applicable industry is not bad at all, as long as what you do is Math-related. I know many very intelligent people who are content doing things like Computational Geometry or Numerical Optimization in industry for most of their lives.</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-136" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 136)</h4>
<p>As far as possible, you should turn yourself into the kind of person who does not have to remember the theorem in question. To get to that stage, the best way I know is simply to attempt to prove the theorem yourself. If you’ve tried sufficiently hard at that and got stuck, then have a quick look at the proof – just enough to find out what the point is that you are missing. That should give you an Aha! feeling that will make the step far easier to remember in the future than if you had just passively read it.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2-score-41" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 41)</h4>
<p>I’m teaching a course right now in which many students face these issues for the first time.</p>
<p>I have to care about something to remember it; otherwise I am utterly incapable of memorizing anything. My main method to care about a proof is to want to be convinced of the thing being proved, the way that a trial jury wants to be convinced. If the stated theorem just isn’t news to you, ask yourself if you know whether it remains true if you change it slightly. Would the same proof still work?</p>
<p>Example 1: det(AB) = det(A)det(B) for square matrices. It seems completely unreasonable to dismiss a theorem like this as “obvious”. If you haven’t learned a proof, then the only evidence left is argument by example and argument by authority. Many variations of this equation certainly aren’t true, so why is this one true? The goal is to learn the proof well enough to be able to persuade someone else who doesn’t believe you.</p>
<p>Example 2: Every fraction is a repeating decimal. This is a familiar fact and we all “know” it. So make a variation to have something more newsworthy to prove. If every a/b must be a repeating decimal, then presumably you can find a bound for when it starts to repeat. For instance, it seems unlikely that 1/29 requires a million digits to start to repeat. Does the proof that a/b must repeat establish a reasonable bound on when?</p>

<section id="answer-3-score-35-1" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 35)</h4>
<p>I appreciate the sentiment that you shouldn’t memorize theorems, but I think it goes too far. Some theorems are just not that memorable. You can prove them over and over and they don’t stick. And if you use a theorem repeatedly, it’s worthwhile to memorize it so that you won’t have to interrupt the flow of your thought to look up or derive the result.</p>
<p>Diagrams sometimes help. For example, here’s a diagram of <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/distribution_chart.html">relationships between probability distributions</a> that I’ve often referred to. And here’s a diagram relating various <a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/05/25/diagramming-modes-of-convergence/">modes of convergence</a>.</p>

<h3>86: Examples of great mathematical writing (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/358.html">38222</a> in 2009)</h3>
<section id="question-85" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>This question is basically from <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/">Ravi Vakil</a>’s web page, but modified for Math Overflow.</p>
<p><em>How do I write mathematics well?</em> Learning by example is more helpful than being told what to do, so let’s try to name as many examples of “great writing” as possible. Asking for “the best article you’ve read” isn’t reasonable or helpful. Instead, ask yourself the question “what is a great article?”, and implicitly, “what makes it great?”</p>
<p>If you think of a piece of mathematical writing you think is “great”, check if it’s already on the list. If it is, vote it up. If not, add it, with an explanation of why you think it’s great. This question is “Community Wiki”, which means that the question (and all answers) generate no reputation for the person who posted it. It also means that once you have 100 reputation, you can edit the posts (e.g. add a blurb that doesn’t fit in a comment about why a piece of writing is great). <strong>Remember that each answer should be about a <em>single</em> piece of “great writing”, and please restrict yourself to posting one answer per day.</strong></p>
<p>I refuse to give criteria for greatness; that’s your job. But please don’t propose writing that has a major flaw unless it is outweighed by some other truly outstanding qualities. In particular, “great writing” is not the same as “proof of a great theorem”. You are not allowed to recommend anything by yourself, because you’re such a great writer that it just wouldn’t be fair.</p>

<p>Anything by John Milnor fits the bill.

Canonical submission: Anything by J.-P. Serre (e.g., Local Fields, Trees, Algebraic Groups and Class Fields,…). Reasons:

I can’t get enough of Trees, chapter 2. I spent a year working on automorphic forms on function fields in part because of this book (it didn’t work out well, but that’s another story).

<li>
Peer pressure: several people (including my Ph.D. advisor) have told me that if I were to choose a role model for writing style, I should choose him.
</li>
<li>
Mundane reasons: His writing is incredibly clear and concise, but not so brief as to be confusing. He has a keen eye for what is important in a theory or construction. He doesn’t waste words having a conversation with the reader or expounding on his philosophy of mathematical practice.

<h4>Answer 3 (score 73)</h4>
<p>True story: When I was about to move to Stony Brook to start my PhD, one of my professors took me aside to tell me “You know, when I was a student Milnor was god, and <i>Morse Theory</i> was the bible.” I found that nice and moved on, but a little later a younger professor took me aside to say “You know, when I was a student Milnor was god, and <i>Introduction to Algebraic K-Theory</i> was the bible.” By then I knew that something was going on, but I was still taken by surprise when a more junior professor found me and said “You know, when I was a student Milnor was god, and <i>Characteristic Classes</i> was the bible.”</p>
<p>Of course this was all planned. They succeeded in motivating me to take every opportunity to talk to and learn from the big names I met. But they made another point that I only recognized later, while writing my first paper: <i>If you want to learn to write Mathematics <b>well</b>, read anything by Milnor</i>.</p>

<p>
The inequality <span class="math display">\[\det(A+B)\geq \det A +\det B\]</span> is implied by the Minkowski determinant theorem <span class="math display">\[(\det(A+B))^{1/n}\geq (\det A)^{1/n}+(\det B)^{1/n}\]</span> which holds true for any non-negative <span class="math inline">\(n\times n\)</span> Hermitian matrices <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.

<p>We have <span class="math inline">\(((A+B)x,x)\ge (Ax,x)\)</span>. It then follows from the variational characterization of eigenvalues (min-max theorem) that the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(A+B\)</span> are greater than or equal to those of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.

</section>
<section id="answer-3-score-32-2" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 32)</h4>
<p>
Yet another way to see this is to note that <span class="math inline">\(A = \overline{Q}^{t}Q\)</span> for some invertible matrix <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\({\rm det}(A+B) = |{\rm det}(Q)|^{2}{\rm det}{( I + (\overline{Q}^{-1}})^{t}BQ^{-1})\)</span>.` Now <span class="math inline">\((\overline{Q}^{-1})^{t}BQ^{-1}\)</span> is Hermitian, and positive definite. It suffices to prove that if <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is positive definite and Hermitian, then <span class="math inline">\({\rm det}(I+X) \geq (1 + {\rm det}X)\)</span>. We may conjugate <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by a unitary matrix <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and assume that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is diagonal. Let the eigenvalues of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_{1},\ldots, \lambda_{n}\)</span>, (allowing repetitions). Then <span class="math inline">\({\rm det}(I+X) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}(1 + \lambda_{i}) \geq 1 + \prod_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_{i} = 1 + {\rm det}X.\)</span> Such an argument appears in some proofs by R. Brauer, though I do not know whether it originates with him.
</p>
<p>
Later edit: Incidentally, I think that with the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality and a slightly more careful analysis, you can see by this approach that for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> as above, you do have <span class="math inline">\({\rm det}(I+X) \geq (1 +({\rm det}X)^{1/n})^{n}\)</span> (a special case of the inequality of Minkowski mentioned in the accepted answer, but enough to prove the general case by an argument similar to that above). For set <span class="math inline">\(d = {\rm det}X\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(s_{m}(\lambda_{1},\ldots ,\lambda_{n})\)</span> denote the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-th elementary symmetric function evaluated at the eigenvalues. Using the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality yields that <span class="math inline">\(s_{m}(\lambda_{1},\ldots ,\lambda_{n}) \geq \left( \begin{array}{clcr} n\\m \end{array} \right)d^{m/n}\)</span>, so we obtain <span class="math inline">\({\rm det}(I+X) \geq (1+d^{1/n})^{n}.\)</span>

<h4>Answer accepted (score 63)</h4>
<p>[It is] Not really [bad to cite an arXiv paper]<sup>*</sup>. If the paper on arXiv provides the result you want, you are free to cite it. Before the arXiv, citing “private communication” or “pre-print” is not unheard of. On the other hand, since it hasn’t been peer reviewed, you probably should double check and make sure you understand and believe the paper before you cite it (if you use one of its results crucially) (not that you shouldn’t do the same for peer-reviewed papers, just that one may want to be extra careful with referring to pre-prints).</p>
<p>Note that there are two reasons for citations. The first is to give credit where credit is due: you do not want to look like you are appropriating someone else’s result (or in some cases, inadvertently slighting somebody by sin of omission). The second is to provide references for assertions made without proof in your paper. Obviously if you are citing for the former reason, a paper is arXiv is really no different from a paper in a published journal. If the author’s right, you covered your bases. If he was wrong, then better for you, perhaps. It is with the latter case you need to be more careful. If the paper has been on arXiv for a long time and not appeared in any journals (definition of “long time” of course vary from field to field), you may want to be a bit cautious in deciding whether the foundation to your house is sound.</p>
<p>Also, how do you know “no publication or review seems to be in the pipeline”? I know several people (myself included) who would only include the journal ref on arXiv after it has been accepted for publication. Perhaps you should double check with the original author whether it has been submitted, and if not, why not?</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 63)</h4>
<p>[It is] Not really [bad to cite an arXiv paper]<sup>*</sup>. If the paper on arXiv provides the result you want, you are free to cite it. Before the arXiv, citing “private communication” or “pre-print” is not unheard of. On the other hand, since it hasn’t been peer reviewed, you probably should double check and make sure you understand and believe the paper before you cite it (if you use one of its results crucially) (not that you shouldn’t do the same for peer-reviewed papers, just that one may want to be extra careful with referring to pre-prints).</p>
<p>Note that there are two reasons for citations. The first is to give credit where credit is due: you do not want to look like you are appropriating someone else’s result (or in some cases, inadvertently slighting somebody by sin of omission). The second is to provide references for assertions made without proof in your paper. Obviously if you are citing for the former reason, a paper is arXiv is really no different from a paper in a published journal. If the author’s right, you covered your bases. If he was wrong, then better for you, perhaps. It is with the latter case you need to be more careful. If the paper has been on arXiv for a long time and not appeared in any journals (definition of “long time” of course vary from field to field), you may want to be a bit cautious in deciding whether the foundation to your house is sound.</p>
<p>Also, how do you know “no publication or review seems to be in the pipeline”? I know several people (myself included) who would only include the journal ref on arXiv after it has been accepted for publication. Perhaps you should double check with the original author whether it has been submitted, and if not, why not?</p>

<h4>Answer 3 (score 32)</h4>
<p>
As has already been noted: there are two reasons to cite a paper, an email, a letter, or anything else:
</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>To give credit.</p></li>
<li><p>To refer to a result you need.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
If a citation is for reason (1), you should cite anything and everything that is appropriate. If someone explained a result to you in an email, cite them, or at least acknowledge them in the paper. If you rely on the results of a preprint, or a preprint proves important results germaine to your own work, you should cite it (whether it appeared on the arxiv or not!).
</p>
<p>
As for reason (2), it is up to you. In general, you shouldn’t be relying on results unless you are confident that they are true. Typically, it is up to you to determine your own threshhold of confidence, and if publication in a peer-reviewed journal increases your confidence, you can take that into account. But in this context you must still take into account criterion (1): i.e. even if you avoid relying on an unpublished result out of a sense of caution, but that unpublished result is closely related to what you are doing, you should still mention it. (A typical situation might be that you need a special case of an unpublished result that it is easy for you to prove directly, and you prefer to do so rather than rely on the unpublished result; then you can certainly do so, but you should point out that what you have proved is a special case of the more general result, and cite that more general result.)
</p>
<p>One thing to note is that some journals may not accept your paper if it relies crucially on unpublished results (including unpublished results of yours!). Thus, if you rely on such results, you may want to include a sketch of the proof, so as to make your presentation somewhat self-contained. In this case, if you giving a sketch of the proof of someone elses result, be sure to include appropriate citations from category (1) above!</p>

<section id="question-88" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Related: question #879, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/879/most-interesting-mathematics-mistake">Most interesting mathematics mistake</a>. But the intent of this question is more pedagogical.</p>
<p>In many branches of mathematics, it seems to me that a good counterexample can be worth just as much as a good theorem or lemma. The only branch where I think this is explicitly recognized in the literature is topology, where for example Munkres is careful to point out and discuss his favorite counterexamples in his book, and <em>Counterexamples in Topology</em> is quite famous. The art of coming up with counterexamples, especially minimal counterexamples, is in my mind an important one to cultivate, and perhaps it is not emphasized enough these days.</p>
<p>So: what are your favorite examples of counterexamples that really illuminate something about some aspect of a subject?</p>
<p>Bonus points if the counterexample is minimal in some sense, bonus points if you can make this sense rigorous, and extra bonus points if the counterexample was important enough to impact yours or someone else’s research, especially if it was simple enough to present in an undergraduate textbook.</p>
<p>As usual, please limit yourself to <strong>one counterexample per answer.</strong></p>

The matrix <span class="math inline">\(\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 &amp;amp; 1\\ 0 &amp;amp; 0\end{smallmatrix}\right)\)</span> has the following wonderful properties. (Feel free to add or edit; I can’t remember all the reason I loathed it when I was learning linear algebra. It’s funny how unexciting they all now seem, but it’s a counterexample for almost every wrong linear algebra proof I tried to give.)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Only zeroes as eigenvalues, but non-zero minimal polynomial (in particular, the minimal polynomial has bigger degree than the number of eigenvalues). Probably my favorite way to state this fact: <em>the minimal polynomial is not irreducible or square-free</em>. The same thing in a fancier language: the Jordan canonical form is not diagonal.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not diagonalizable, even over an algebraically closed field.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Not divisible over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb C\)</span>. There are no matrices <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and integers <span class="math inline">\(n\ge2\)</span> so that <span class="math inline">\(M^n = \left(\begin{smallmatrix}0 &amp;amp; 1\\\
0 &amp;amp; 0\end{smallmatrix}\right).\)</span> All diagonalizable and most non-diagonalizable complex matrices have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th roots.
</p>
(This is because, if there was a square root, it’d have minimal polynomial <em>x<sup>4</sup></em>, but since it’s a two-by-two matrix, Cayley-Hamilton implies that the characteristic polynomial has degree 2).
</li>
<li>
<p>
The matrix is nilpotent but not zero.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It’s one of the best examples when you need to remember why matrix multiplication is not commutative.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Thinking of <em>k<sup>2</sup></em> as a <em>k[x]</em>-module where <em>x</em> acts as this matrix should give wonderful (counter)-examples of modules for all the same reasons.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, <span class="math inline">\(\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1 &amp;amp; 1\\ 0 &amp;amp; 1\end{smallmatrix}\right)\)</span> is an example of an <em>invertible</em> matrix with the first three properties above. Its action on <em>k<sup>2</sup></em> is in some sense the simplest example of a representation of a group (<span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>) which is indecomposable but not irreducible.</p>

<p>A polynomial <span class="math inline">\(p(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]\)</span> is irreducible if it is irreducible <span class="math inline">\(\bmod l\)</span> for some prime <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. This is an important and useful enough sufficient criterion for irreducibility that one might wonder whether it is necessary: in other words, if <span class="math inline">\(p(x)\)</span> is irreducible, is it necessarily irreducible <span class="math inline">\(\bmod l\)</span> for some prime <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>?</p>
<p>The answer is no.

This is because for every odd prime <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, one of <span class="math inline">\(2, -2, -1\)</span> is a quadratic residue. In the first case, <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x^2 + 2 \sqrt{2} x + 4)(x^2 - 2 \sqrt{2} x + 4)\)</span>. In the second case, <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x^2 + 2 \sqrt{-2} x - 4)(x^2 - 2 \sqrt{-2} x - 4)\)</span>. In the third case, <span class="math inline">\(p(x) = (x^2 + 4i)(x^2 - 4i)\)</span>. This result can be thought of as a failure of a local-global principle, and the counterexample is minimal in the sense that the answer is yes for quadratic and cubic polynomials.</p>

<p>In geometry/topology, there are (at least) three specialized journals that end up publishing a large fraction of the best papers in the subject – Geometry and Topology, JDG, and GAFA.</p>
<p>What journals play a similar role in other subjects?</p>
<p>Let me be more specific.

<p>The following is my personal (i.e., includes all of my mathematical prejudices) ranked list of subject area journals in number theory.</p>
<p>From best to worst:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><em>Algebra and Number Theory</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>International Journal of Number Theory</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Journal de Theorie des Nombres de Bordeaux</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Journal of Number Theory</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Acta Arithmetica</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Integers: The Journal of Combinatorial Number Theory</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Journal of Integer Sequences</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>JP Journal of Algebra and Number Theory</em></p></li>

<p>For a slightly longer list, see</p>
<p><a href="http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/N6.html">http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/N6.html</a></p>
<p>but I don’t have any personal experience with the journals listed there but not above.</p>
<p>Moreover, I think 1) is clearly the best (a very good journal), then 2)-5) are of roughly similar quality (all quite solid), then 6) and 7) have some nice papers and also some papers which I find not so interesting, novel and/or correct; I have not seen an interesting paper published in 8).</p>
<p>But I don’t think that even 1) is as prestigious as the top subject journals in certain other areas, e.g. JDG or GAFA. There are some other excellent journals which, although not subject area journals, seem to be rather partial to number theory, e.g. Crelle, Math. Annalen, Compositio Math.</p>
<p>Finally, as far as analytic and combinatorial number theory goes, I think 4) and 5) should be reversed. (Were I an analytic number theorist, this would have caused me to rank 5) higher than 4) overall.)</p>

<p>Combinatorics: In my opinion, Discrete Mathematics is only a mediocre journal (I wouldn’t consider this top journal). Yes, it contains good papers, but it contains a <em>lot</em> of papers… on average… it’s average.</p>
<p>Some other ones worth a mention (on top of JCTA, JACO and EJoC mentioned earlier): Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B, Journal of Combinatorial Designs, Annals of Combinatorics, Combinatorica.</p>
<p>The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics should probably go on the top list in combinatorics, but since it’s a free, open access journal, it’s usually assumed to be worse than it actually is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Combinatorics, Probability, and Computing, the Journal of Graph Theory and the <em>Electronic</em> Journal of Combinatorics seem to be widely regarded as excellent journals, at the level of the ones mentioned above (except Discrete Mathematics).</p>
<p>Formerly, the “Journal of Combinatorics” referred to a printed version of the “Electronic Journal of Combinatorics” (which has led to some confusion, see e.g. <a href="http://symomega.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/the-arc-the-era-and-the-ejc/">http://symomega.wordpress.com/2010/03/30/the-arc-the-era-and-the-ejc/</a>), although most people in combinatorics haven’t even heard of it.</p>

<p>In mathematical physics, <em>Communications in Mathematical Physics</em> is among the top journals I guess.</p>
<p>There are two other journals I would consider to be above average: <em>Advances in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics</em> and the <em>Journal of High Energy Physics</em>, which publish lots of high-quality mathematical physics papers, especially at the formal end of <code>hep-th</code>. Of course, I have heard if mentioned in the past that, especially in US maths departments where they care about this sort of things, <em>Communications</em> is considered a mathematics journal, whereas <em>JHEP</em> perhaps is not, the jury still being out on <em>ATMP</em>. Hence if you are a mathematician thinking of publishing a good paper in mathematical physics and want to publish in what potential employers might consider (however narrow-minded this consideration might be) a mathematics journal, then perhaps <em>Communications</em> is the way to go. The quality of papers there is consistently above average.</p>

All of Quantum Mechanics is based on the notion of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Observables are represented by hermitian operators Q, their determinate states are eigenvectors of Q, a measure of the observable can only yield an eigenvalue of the corresponding operator Q. If you measure an observable in the state <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> in a system and find as result the eigenvalue <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, the state of the system just after the measurement will be the normed projection of <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> onto the eigenvector associated to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. And so on and so forth.
</p>
<p>Of course Quantum Physics is not mathematically trivial: the arena is infinite dimensional Hilbert Space (or more complicated functional analytic structures like Gelfand triples), operators are not bounded, etc…However, in the extremely fast growing field of Quantum Computing the algebra is mostly limited to finite-dimensional spaces and their operators.</p>
<p>Finally, let me mention that Frank Wilczek, a winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, has interestingly reminisced that as a student he found Quantum Mechanics easier than Classical Mechanics because of its nice axiomatization alluded to above..</p>

<h3>93: Knuth’s intuition that Goldbach might be unprovable (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/27755.html">35889</a> in 2010)</h3>
<section id="question-92" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Knuth’s intuition that Goldbach’s conjecture (every even number greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes) might be one of the statements that can neither be proved nor disproved really puzzles me. (See page 321 of <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200203/fea-knuth.pdf">http://www.ams.org/notices/200203/fea-knuth.pdf</a> )</p>
<p>All the examples of such statements I have heard until now were very abstract, but this one is so concrete.</p>
<p>My question is that is there such an example of a statement of this sort that is proved to be unprovable, i.e., for some property P(n), the statement that “every natural number n satisfies P(n)”. (In the Goldbach case P(n) would be “if n is an even number greater than 2, then there exists two primes p and q such that n = p + q”.)</p>
<p>If Knuth is right, it would be very interesting in one sense: the negation of Goldbach is obviously provable if it is true. So if someone proves that Goldbach is not provable, then we would know that Goldbach is true. We would be sure that someone would never come up with an example that would violate the condition. For the practical man, this is as good as it is proven.</p>
<p>Edit: I have learned a lot from the answers, thank you so much!</p>

<section id="answer-accepted-score-147" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 147)</h4>
<p>When we say that a statement is undecidable, this is implicitly with regard to some axiom system, such as Peano arithmetic or ZFC. The reason why statements about arithmetic can be undecidable is that there exist inequivalent models of arithmetic that obey such axiom systems (this is a consequence of the Godel completeness and incompleteness theorems, assuming of course that the axiom system being used is consistent and recursively enumerable). For instance, the standard or “true” natural numbers obey the Peano axioms, but so do some more exotic number systems (e.g. the nonstandard natural numbers). It is conceivable that a given statement in arithmetic, such as Goldbach’s conjecture, holds for the true natural numbers but not for some other number systems that obey the Peano axioms, though personally I view this possibility as remote. (Note that the nonstandard natural numbers satisfy exactly the same first-order statements as the standard natural numbers, by Los’s theorem, but one can also construct other, weirder, models of arithmetic which have a genuinely different theory.)</p>
<p>So, if Goldbach’s conjecture is undecidable for some given axiom system, what this would imply is that every “true” even natural number larger than 4 is the sum of two primes (otherwise we could disprove Goldbach with an argument of finite length), but that there exists a more exotic number system (larger than the true natural numbers) obeying those axioms which contains some even exotic number that is not the sum of two (exotic) primes. (Note that the length of a proof has to be true natural number, rather than an exotic one, so the existence of an exotic counterexample cannot be directly converted to a disproof of Goldbach.) This is an unlikely scenario, but not an <em>a priori</em> impossible one (as one can see from the example of Goodstein’s theorem or the Paris-Harrington theorem).</p>
<p>[Edit: here, as usual, when talking about things like the “true” natural numbers, one has to work in some external reasoning system which may be distinct from the reasoning system one is analysing the decidability of. For instance, one may be using ZFC as one’s external reasoning system to analyse what can and cannot be decided in Peano arithmetic, with the true natural numbers then being constructed by, say, the von Neumann ordinal construction combined with the axiom of infinity. Or one could be using an informal external reasoning system, based perhaps on some Platonic beliefs about mathematical objects, that is not explicitly axiomatised. It’s best to keep the external system conceptually distinct from any internal ones being studied, as one can get hopelessly confused otherwise.]</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 100)</h4>
<p>I once heard Don Zagier talk of a more general intuition that the quality that may make some natural statements unprovable is the quality of telling you just what you would expect to happen anyway. For example, the statement that pi has infinitely many zeros in its decimal expansion may be hard, or even impossible, to prove precisely because it would be a miracle if it were false – so that if it is true it doesn’t have to have a <em>reason</em> for being true.</p>
<p>Goldbach’s conjecture is an interesting case for this heuristic. If one combines appropriate “the primes are random” heuristics with the experimental knowledge that it is true up to some very large finite number, then one can argue that the probability that it is false is absolutely tiny. So it might seem like a prime candidate for Zagier’s class of difficult problem. And indeed it is at the very least extremely difficult. But there are closely related theorems, such as Vinogradov’s three-primes theorem (that every sufficiently large odd number is the sum of three primes) that are proved by <em>exploiting</em> the random-like behaviour of the primes. That is, in a sense one actually proves the heuristic that tells you that the theorem is what you would expect to be true. From this point of view, what makes Goldbach hard is that the method of proof breaks down badly: the notions of quasirandomness we have just aren’t strong enough to guarantee that sumsets of quasirandom sets have no gaps. (They can tell us things like that almost every even number is a sum of two primes, in a pretty strong sense of “almost every”.)</p>
<p>So one might say that, given that the techniques break down, Zagier’s criterion applies again. But I’m uneasy about this – number theorists who have thought much harder about Goldbach’s conjecture than I have are agreed that the problem is currently out of reach, but I have sometimes heard them speculating in some detail about what a proof might look like. And Vinogradov’s three-primes theorem might look like a great candidate for the criterion to someone who didn’t know about the circle method.</p>
<p>But I think one can at least say that it is conceivable that Goldbach’s conjecture “just happens to be true”, whereas a conjecture that asserts something “unlikely” tends, if it is true, to have to be true for a reason.</p>

<p>It’s equivalent to asking about possibilities such as “aliens land on Earth and provide us a proof that Peano Arithmetic can’t prove Goldbach”, or “an ancient cuneiform tablet is found containing an RSA-encrypted proof that Riemann Hypothesis is independent of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory”. Although in such a scenario Goldbach (resp. RH) would be found to be PA-unprovable, that would happen only as a result of developments so stupendous that Goldbach and its provability become trifling afterthoughts, and one might as well ask directly about probability of alien landings or Babylonian codices.</p>
<p>The only currently known way for Goldbach to be unprovable is if within the additive combinatorics of the prime numbers were encoded a model of Peano Arithmetic (ie., PA could derive a model of itself from a PA-constructible function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> such that for all <span class="math inline">\(n&amp;gt;1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g(n)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((2n - g(n))\)</span> are odd primes). This would imply a degree of rigidity and intricate structure in the primes so far beyond the existing ideas — such as the expectation that weak analogues of geometry and topology are manifested in algebraic number theory (zeta functions), or that some degree of probabilistic (quasirandom) structure exists in additive number theory — as to completely dwarf any mathematics that currently exists.</p>
<p>The equally earth-shaking alternative means by which Goldbach could be shown to transcend PA, is if entirely new methods are found for demonstrating PA-unprovability of relatively “generic” (ordinary, concrete) mathematical statements. Presumably this would mean that not only Goldbach, but a very large number of other open conjectures would be seen to also transcend Peano Arithmetic (and, in the process, be solved in a stronger system such as ZF). A general machine for turning a large volume of conjectures into ZFC theorems with PA unprovability certificates would, in the same way as the alien landings, be of such overwhelming importance and surprise as to make Goldbach itself irrelevant.</p>
<p>While any future discoveries are hypothetically possible, the only existing evidence for the demonstrable PA-unprovability of Goldbach (i.e., for the idea that a proof will be found in a stronger theory, such as ZF, that Goldbach transcends PA) is the body of Goedel-type unprovability and independence results derived in the past 80 years, and nothing in that or any other branch of mathematics suggests either the prospect of incredibly fine structure in the primes or of generic methods for showing unprovability. So to talk seriously of Goldbach or the Riemann Hypothesis being shown to be PA-unprovable is essentially an unadulterated speculation that a totally new species of mathematics will be discovered, a speculation that is not related to any specific feature of any particular number theoretic problem.</p>

<h4>Question</h4>
<h5>
The purpose of this question is to collect the most outrageous (or ridiculous) conjectures in mathematics.
</h2>
<p>An outrageous conjecture is qualified <strong>ONLY</strong> if:</p>
<h5>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is most likely false
</h3></li>
</ol>
<p>(Being hopeless is NOT enough.)</p>
<h5>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>It is not known to be false
</h3></li>
</ol>
<h5>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It was published or made publicly before 2006.
</h3></li>
</ol>
<h5>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>It is Important:
</h3></li>
</ol>
<p>
(It is based on some appealing heuristic or idea; refuting it will be important etc.)
</p>
<h5>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>IT IS NOT just the negation of a famous commonly believed conjecture.
</h3></li>
</ol>
<p>As always with big list problems please make one conjecture per answer. (I am not sure this is really a big list question, since I am not aware of many such outrageous conjectures. I am aware of one wonderful example that I hope to post as an answer in a couple of weeks.)</p>
<p><em>Very important examples where the conjecture was believed as false when it was made but this is no longer the consensus may also qualify!</em></p>
<p>Shmuel Weinberger <a href="https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/11/19/about-conjectures-shmuel-weinberger/" rel="noreferrer">described various types of mathematical conjectures</a>. And the type of conjectures the question proposes to collect is of the kind:</p>

<p>W. Hugh Woodin, at a 1992 seminar in Berkeley at which I was present, proposed a new and ridiculously strong large cardinal concept, now called the <a href="http://cantorsattic.info/Berkeley">Berkeley cardinals</a>, and challenged the seminar audience to refute their existence.</p>
<p>He ridiculed the cardinals as overly strong, stronger than Reinhardt cardinals, and proposed them in a “Refute this!” manner that seems to be in exactly the spirit of your question.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no-one has yet succeeded in refuting the Berkeley cardinals.</p>

<p>A long-standing conjecture in Number Theory is that for each positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> there is no stretch of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> consecutive integers containing more primes than the stretch from 2 to <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>. Just looking at a table of primes and seeing how they thin out is enough to make the conjecture plausible.</p>
<p>But Hensley and Richards (Primes in intervals, Acta Arith 25 (1973/74) 375-391, MR0396440) proved that this conjecture is incompatible with an equally long-standing conjecture, the prime <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-tuples conjecture.</p>
<p>The current consensus, I believe, is that prime <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-tuples is true, while the first conjecture is false (but not proved to be false).</p>

<h3>95: Difference between a ‘calculus’ and an ‘algebra’ (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/36758.html">35572</a> in 2011)</h3>
<section id="question-94" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>
What is really the conceptual difference between a calculus and an algebra. Eg. Is SKI combinator calculus really a calculus?
</p>
<p>A friend claims that free variables are fundamental for a calculus, and as such that SKI is not a calculus, but an algebra.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-15" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 15)</h4>
<p>In logic, the terminology seems to have been influenced by two factors. The very early development of various deductive systems was done by people who were more philosophers than mathematicians and who seem to have used “calculus” to refer to anything that looked mathematical. Also, that development took place before “algebra” had acquired all of its current meanings.</p>
<p>My impression is that the use of “calculus” in logic is restricted to the meaning of “formal deductive system” — and usually rather old systems. As for the SKI system of combinators, I would call it a calculus if you’re talking about rules of inference. But if you mean the system of all combinators, with the operation of application, generated by S and K (I is redundant), then this is an algebra.</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2-score-10" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 10)</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/calculus">Webster’s</a> defines the primary definition of a <code>calculus</code> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
a method of computation or calculation in a special notation (as of logic or symbolic logic)
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/calculus">Wiktionary</a> gives a similar definition:</p>
<blockquote>
Any formal system in which symbolic expressions are manipulated according to fixed rules.
</blockquote>
<p>This agrees very much with the definitions I have encountered within mathematics. Free variables are not a requirement; indeed, even variables are not strictly required as objects within a calculus. (I am aware that there exist proof calculi that don’t deal with the concept of variables; perhaps someone could give the name of such a one.)</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-3-score-8-1" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 3 (score 8)</h4>
<p>Mathematics is an activity of investigation and exploration. Informally, both calculi and an algebras are tools which consist of sets of symbols and systems of rules (usually called axioms) for manipulating those symbols.</p>
<p>Calculi tend to be specified/defined/explored/used to answer questions of “calculation” or reckoning, in some very general sense. Calculi tend to be used to investigate properties of objects (i.e “What is the area under the curve?”)</p>
<p>Algebras tend to be specified/defined/explored/used to answer questions about how different “things” are related, in some very general sense. Algebras tend to be used to study the relationship between objects. (i.e. “Is this equation ‘the same’ as that equation?”)</p>
<p>I think it is safe to say that the term “algebra” today, carries a bit more meaning to most mathematicians than the general teram “calculus”.</p>
<p>As examples:</p>
<p>The Calculus (as taught in high-school or undergraduate university), also known as “infinitesimal calculus”, is a calculus focused on limits, functions, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series. It is chiefly concerned with calculations or answering questions about change. The Calculus uses the complex numbers (chiefly) as a foundation for this investigation.</p>
<p>Opening a book on computer science, you might find a “calculus of computation” which might involve symbols and rules which let one “calculate” or “discover” behavioral properties of a computer program. As a foundation, such a calculus might use “states” and “transitions”, instead of the complex numbers, to ground the investigation.</p>
<p>Elementary Algebra (ie. high-school algebra) is, informally, the study of relationships of variables and structures (e.g. equations) arising from combining variables according to certain rules (i.e. performing “operations”). It uses the complex numbers as the basic foundation in which one could “check” or “verify” statements, but quickly one finds that “calculating with numbers” is not that useful (or practical) in investigating relationships between equations.</p>
<p>“The general theory of arithmetic operations is algebra: so we can also develop an algebra of set theory.” - Concepts of Modern Mathematics, Ian Stewart</p>
<p>In that sense, Elementary Algebra is more “abstract” than arithmetic, and is often the subject where schools (specifically bad teachers) lose a student’s interest and attention in mathematics. It is a tragedy, since it is exactly at Elementary Algebra that things get interesting.</p>
<p>In computer science or other engineering disciplines, you might find a “process algebra” when reasoning about how various states of a computer program relate to each other. We can ask questions like “is a specification of a collection of processes ‘functionally equivalent’ to another specification (i.e do they do the same thing? as in the case of a particular hardware design versus a software program)? The same”process algebra&quot; could possibly be used to reason about how the various “states” of a garage door opener relate to each. Such an algebra might use states, transitions, and time as a foundation.</p>

<h3>96: A learning roadmap for algebraic geometry (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1291.html">35176</a> in )</h3>
<section id="question-95" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>Unfortunately this question is relatively general, and also has a lot of sub-questions and branches associated with it; however, I suspect that other students wonder about it and thus hope it may be useful for other people too. I’m interested in learning modern Grothendieck-style algebraic geometry in depth. I have some familiarity with classical varieties, schemes, and sheaf cohomology (via Hartshorne and a fair portion of EGA I) but would like to get into some of the fancy modern things like stacks, étale cohomology, intersection theory, moduli spaces, etc. However, there is a vast amount of material to understand before one gets there, and there seems to be a big jump between each pair of sources. Bourbaki apparently didn’t get anywhere near algebraic geometry.</p>
<p>So, does anyone have any suggestions on how to tackle such a broad subject, references to read (including motivation, preferably!), or advice on which order the material should ultimately be learned–including the prerequisites? Is there ultimately an “algebraic geometry sucks” phase for every aspiring algebraic geometer, as Harrison suggested on these forums for pure algebra, that only (enormous) persistence can overcome?</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-36" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 36)</h4>
<p>FGA Explained. Articles by a bunch of people, most of them free online. You have Vistoli explaining what a Stack is, with Descent Theory, Nitsure constructing the Hilbert and Quot schemes, with interesting special cases examined by Fantechi and Goettsche, Illusie doing formal geometry and Kleiman talking about the Picard scheme.</p>
<p>For intersection theory, I second Fulton’s book.</p>
<p>And for more on the Hilbert scheme (and Chow varieties, for that matter) I rather like the first chapter of Kollar’s “Rational Curves on Algebraic Varieties”, though he references a couple of theorems in Mumfords “Curves on Surfaces” to do the construction.</p>
<p>And on the “algebraic geometry sucks” part, I never hit it, but then I’ve been just grabbing things piecemeal for awhile and not worrying too much about getting a proper, thorough grounding in any bit of technical stuff until I really need it, and when I do anything, I always just fall back to focus on varieties over C to make sure I know what’s going on.</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention, Gelfand, Kapranov, Zelevinsky “Discriminants, resultants and multidimensional determinants” covers a lot of ground, fairly concretely, including Chow varieties and some toric stuff, if I recall right (don’t have it in front of me)</p>

<h4>Answer 2 (score 23)</h4>
<p>Concentrated reading on any given topic—especially one in algebraic geometry, where there is so much technique—is nearly impossible, at least for people with my impatient idiosyncracy. It’s much easier to proceed as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Ask an expert to explain a topic to you, the main ideas, that is, and the main theorems. Keep diligent notes of the conversations.
<li>
Try to prove the theorems in your notes or find a toy analogue that exhibits some of the main ideas of the theory and try to prove the main theorems there; you’ll fail terribly, most likely.
<li>
Once you’ve failed enough, go back to the expert, and ask for a reference.
<li>
Open the reference at the page of the most important theorem, and start reading.
<li>
<p>Every time you find a word you don’t understand or a theorem you don’t know about, look it up and try to understand it, but don’t read too much. At this stage, it helps to have a table of contents of <em>FGA explained</em>-<em>EGA</em>-<em>SGA</em> where you can quickly look up unknown words. Keep diligent notes of your progress, and talk to your expert as much as possible.</p>
Then go back to step 2.
</ol>
<p>An example of a topic that lends itself to this kind of independent study is abelian schemes, where some of the main topics are (with references in parentheses):</p>
<ol>
<li>
the rigidity lemma (Mumford, <em>Geometric invariant theory</em>, Chapter 6),
<li>
the theorem of the cube (Raynaud, <em>Faisceaux amples sur les schémas…</em>),
<li>
construction of the dual abelian scheme (Faltings-Chai, Degeneration of abelian varieties, Chapter 1),
<li>
questions of projectivity (Raynaud, <em>Faisceaux amples sur les schemas…</em>),
<li>
Lang-Néron theorem and <span class="math inline">\(K/k\)</span> traces (Brian Conrad’s notes).
<li>
proof that abelian schemes assemble into an algebraic stack (Mumford, <em>Geometric invariant theory</em>, Chapter 7),
<li>
compactifications of the stack of abelian schemes (Faltings-Chai, <em>Degeneration of abelian varieties</em>; Olsson, <em>Canonical compactifications…</em>; Kato and Usui, <em>Classidying spaces of degenerating polarized Hodge structures</em>.)
</ol>
<p>You may amuse yourself by working out the first topics above over an arbitrary base. That’s enough to keep you at work for a few years!</p>
<p>A brilliant epitome of SGA 3 and Gabriel-Demazure is Sancho de Salas, <em>Grupos algebraicos y teoria de invariantes</em>. It explains the general theory of algebraic groups, and the general representation theory of reductive groups using modern language: schemes, fppf descent, etc., in only 400 quatro-sized pages!</p>

<h3>97: What is the definition of “canonical”? (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/19644.html">34492</a> in 2013)</h3>
<section id="question-96" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I just received a referee report criticizing that I would too often use the word “canonical”. I have a certain understanding of what “canonical” should stand for, but the report shows me that other people might think differently. So I am asking:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Is there a definition of “canonical”?

<p>VERY LATE EDIT: I just came across this wonderful passage written by André Weil (Oeuvres, vol. 2, page 558):</p>
<blockquote>
I can assure you, at any rate, that […] my results are invariant, probably canonical, perhaps even functorial.
</blockquote>
</section>
<section id="answer-accepted-score-57-2" class="level4">
<h4>Answer accepted (score 57)</h4>
<p>I always had the following working definition of canonical (which I think Gordon James told me and he might have said it was due to Conway? Not sure): a map <span class="math inline">\(A\to B\)</span> is canonical if you construct a candidate, and the guy in the office next to you constructs a candidate, and you end up with the same map twice.</p>
<p>Somehow there is something more to it than that though. For example if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an abelian group and we want a map <span class="math inline">\(A\to A\)</span> then I will choose the identity, but I know for sure that the wag in the office next door to me will choose the map sending <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-a\)</span> because that’s his sense of humour. What has happened here is that there are in fact two canonical maps <span class="math inline">\(A\to A\)</span>. This issue shows up in class field theory, which is an isomorphism between two rather fancy abelian groups <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and where no-one could decide for a long time which one of the two canonical isomorphisms was “best”. So you often see statements in number theory papers saying “we normalise our class field theory isomorphisms so that geometric Frobenii go to uniformizers” (the alternative being the inverse of this). It also shows up in the Weil pairing on an elliptic curve: it’s canonical, but because we’re in an abelian situation, its inverse is too. So you see in e.g. Katz-Mazur an explicit spelling out of which of the two canonical choices one is going to make (and hang all the non-canonical ones!).</p>
</section>
<section id="answer-2-score-44-1" class="level4">
<h4>Answer 2 (score 44)</h4>
<p>I think there is a multi-level classification associated to “canonicalness,” which explains why some clashes of definition occur.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Arbitrary</em> — No requirements.
</li>
<li>
<em>Uniform</em> — There may be a few options but these options can be selected by making a few global choices.
</li>
<li>
<em>Canonical</em> — As in the uniform case, but there is only one natural choice of options which applies globally.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Canonical examples à la Russell:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Choose one sock from each pair in a collection of sock pairs</em> — There is no way to make a uniform choice.
</li>
<li>
<em>Choose one shoe from each pair in a collection of shoe pairs</em> — There are two obvious global solutions, left shoe or right shoe, but no way to prefer one over the other.
</li>
<li>
<em>Choose one object from each set in a collection of sets each consisting of a bowtie and possibly other items</em> — There is only one obvious global solution.
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the main point of contention is distinguishing <em>uniform</em> and <em>canonical</em>. Some will argue that it’s not canonical if there is a choice to be made, while some will argue that a finite number of global choices is still canonical.</p>
<p>There is yet another use of <em>canonical</em> to mean something like ‘universally sanctioned’ (this is closer to the religious term). The second occurrence of canonical above is of this type.</p>

Not a <em>definition</em>, exactly; I would say the situation is similar to that of <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19405/definition-of-forgetful-functor">forgetful functor</a>. If I say there is a canonical isomorphism between X and Y, then what I mean is that if asked, pretty much everyone would choose the same isomorphism. A canonical isomorphism is very often a natural isomorphism in the sense of category theory, but the converse need not hold. A canonical isomorphism does not need to be the unique isomorphism between X and Y, though sometimes it is when X and Y are considered as equipped with some additional structure.

“There is a canonical isomorphism between the set of elements of a ring R and the set of ring maps <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}[x] \to R\)</span>.” Obviously, I mean for <span class="math inline">\(r \in R\)</span> to correspond to the ring map sending <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, although I could just as well send <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(-r\)</span>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
“There is a canonical isomorphism between a finite-dimensional vector space V and its dual.” No explanation needed, I suppose.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe more interesting would be an example where the word “canonical” is arguably correct or incorrect; I can’t think of one off-hand.</p>
<hr>
<p>Addendum, after reading some of the other answers: I would emphasize that for me there is a difference between “natural” in the formal category-theoretic sense and “canonical”. For one thing there is a linguistic distinction: if I am considering an isomorphism F between X and Y then “Theorem: F is a natural isomorphism” is perfectly acceptable but “Theorem: F is a canonical isomorphism” is very strange to me. There should be only one canonical isomorphism between two things, though what that isomorphism is could depend on context, e.g., “the canonical isomorphism <span class="math inline">\(A \otimes B \to B \otimes A\)</span>” where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are graded abelian groups might mean different things to an algebraic geometer and an algebraic topologist.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, this is hardly a definition, more of a rule of thumb: there is a canonical isomorphism between X and Y if and only if you would feel comfortable writing “X = Y”.</p>

<h3>98: Proofs that require fundamentally new ways of thinking (score <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48771.html">33900</a> in 2018)</h3>
<section id="question-97" class="level4">
<h4>Question</h4>
<p>I do not know exactly how to characterize the class of proofs that interests me, so let me give some examples and say why I would be interested in more. Perhaps what the examples have in common is that a powerful and unexpected technique is introduced that comes to seem very natural once you are used to it.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Euler’s proof that there are infinitely many primes.</p>
<p>If you haven’t seen anything like it before, the idea that you could use <em>analysis</em> to prove that there are infinitely many primes is completely unexpected. Once you’ve seen how it works, that’s a different matter, and you are ready to contemplate trying to do all sorts of other things by developing the method.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> The use of <em>complex</em> analysis to establish the prime number theorem.</p>
<p>Even when you’ve seen Euler’s argument, it still takes a leap to look at the complex numbers. (I’m not saying it can’t be made to seem natural: with the help of Fourier analysis it can. Nevertheless, it is a good example of the introduction of a whole new way of thinking about certain questions.)</p>
<p><strong>Example 3.</strong> Variational methods.</p>
<p>You can pick your favourite problem here: one good one is determining the shape of a heavy chain in equilibrium.</p>
<p><strong>Example 4.</strong> Erdős’s lower bound for Ramsey numbers.</p>
<p>One of the very first results (Shannon’s bound for the size of a separated subset of the discrete cube being another very early one) in probabilistic combinatorics.</p>
<p><strong>Example 5.</strong> Roth’s proof that a dense set of integers contains an arithmetic progression of length 3.</p>
<p>Historically this was by no means the first use of Fourier analysis in number theory. But it was the first application of Fourier analysis to number theory that I personally properly understood, and that completely changed my outlook on mathematics. So I count it as an example (because there exists a plausible fictional history of mathematics where it <em>was</em> the first use of Fourier analysis in number theory).</p>
<p><strong>Example 6.</strong> Use of homotopy/homology to prove fixed-point theorems.</p>
<p>Once again, if you mount a direct attack on, say, the Brouwer fixed point theorem, you probably won’t invent homology or homotopy (though you might do if you then spent a long time reflecting on your proof).</p>
<hr>
<p>The reason these proofs interest me is that they are the kinds of arguments where it is tempting to say that human intelligence was necessary for them to have been discovered. It would probably be possible in principle, if technically difficult, to teach a computer how to apply standard techniques, the familiar argument goes, but it takes a human to <em>invent</em> those techniques in the first place.</p>
<p>Now I don’t buy that argument. I think that it is possible in principle, though technically difficult, for a computer to come up with radically new techniques. Indeed, I think I can give reasonably good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_So_Stories">Just So Stories</a> for some of the examples above. So I’m looking for more examples. The best examples would be ones where a technique just seems to spring from nowhere – ones where you’re tempted to say, “A computer could never have come up with <em>that</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I agree with the first two comments below, and was slightly worried about that when I posted the question. Let me have a go at it though. The difficulty with, say, proving Fermat’s last theorem was of course partly that a new insight was needed. But that wasn’t the only difficulty at all. Indeed, in that case a succession of new insights was needed, and not just that but a knowledge of all the different already existing ingredients that had to be put together. So I suppose what I’m after is problems where essentially the <em>only</em> difficulty is the need for the clever and unexpected idea. I.e., I’m looking for problems that are very good challenge problems for working out how a computer might do mathematics. In particular, I want the main difficulty to be fundamental (coming up with a new idea) and not technical (having to know a lot, having to do difficult but not radically new calculations, etc.). Also, it’s not quite fair to say that the solution of an arbitrary hard problem fits the bill. For example, my impression (which could be wrong, but that doesn’t affect the general point I’m making) is that the recent breakthrough by Nets Katz and Larry Guth in which they solved the Erdős distinct distances problem was a very clever realization that techniques that were already out there could be combined to solve the problem. One could imagine a computer finding the proof by being patient enough to look at lots of different combinations of techniques until it found one that worked. Now their realization itself was amazing and probably opens up new possibilities, but there is a sense in which their breakthrough was not a good example of what I am asking for.</p>
<p>While I’m at it, here’s another attempt to make the question more precise. Many many new proofs are variants of old proofs. These variants are often hard to come by, but at least one starts out with the feeling that there is something out there that’s worth searching for. So that doesn’t really constitute an entirely new way of thinking. (An example close to my heart: the Polymath proof of the density Hales-Jewett theorem was a bit like that. It was a new and surprising argument, but one could see exactly how it was found since it was modelled on a proof of a related theorem. So that is a counterexample to Kevin’s assertion that any solution of a hard problem fits the bill.) I am looking for proofs that seem to come out of nowhere and seem not to be modelled on anything.</p>
<p><strong>Further edit.</strong> I’m not so keen on random massive breakthroughs. So perhaps I should narrow it down further – to proofs that are easy to understand and remember once seen, but seemingly hard to come up with in the first place.</p>

<p>Grothendieck’s insight how to deal with the problem that whatever topology you define on varieties over finite fields, you never seem to get enough open sets. You simply have to re-define what is meant by a topology, allowing open sets not to be subsets of your space but to be covers.</p>
<p>I think this fits the bill of “seem very natural once you are used to it”, but it was an amazing insight, and totally fundamental in the proof of the Weil conjectures.</p>

<p>Although this has already been said elsewhere on MathOverflow, I think it’s worth repeating that Gromov is someone who has arguably introduced more radical thoughts into mathematics than anyone else. Examples involving groups with polynomial growth and holomorphic curves have already been cited in other answers to this question. I have two other obvious ones but there are many more.</p>
<p>I don’t remember where I first learned about convergence of Riemannian manifolds, but I had to laugh because there’s no way I would have ever conceived of a notion. To be fair, all of the groundwork for this was laid out in Cheeger’s thesis, but it was Gromov who reformulated everything as a convergence theorem and recognized its power.</p>
<p>Another time Gromov made me laugh was when I was reading what little I could understand of his book Partial Differential Relations. This book is probably full of radical ideas that I don’t understand. The one I did was his approach to solving the linearized isometric embedding equation. His radical, absurd, but elementary idea was that if the system is sufficiently underdetermined, then the linear partial differential operator could be inverted by another linear partial differential operator. Both the statement and proof are for me the funniest in mathematics. Most of us view solving PDE’s as something that requires hard work, involving analysis and estimates, and Gromov manages to do it using only elementary linear algebra. This then allows him to establish the existence of isometric embedding of Riemannian manifolds in a wide variety of settings.</p>

<p>I am working on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero knowledge proofs</a> and I am looking for a good example of a real world proof of this type. An even better answer would be a Zero Knowledge Proof that shows the statement isn’t true.</p>

<p>The classic example, given in all complexity classes I’ve ever taken, is the following: Imagine your friend is color-blind. You have two billiard balls; one is red, one is green, but they are otherwise identical. To your friend they seem completely identical, and he is skeptical that they are actually distinguishable. You want to prove to him (I say “him” as most color-blind people are male) that they are in fact differently-colored. On the other hand, you do not want him to learn which is red and which is green.</p>
<p>Here is the proof system. You give the two balls to your friend so that he is holding one in each hand. You can see the balls at this point, but you don’t tell him which is which. Your friend then puts both hands behind his back. Next, he either switches the balls between his hands, or leaves them be, with probability 1/2 each. Finally, he brings them out from behind his back. You now have to “guess” whether or not he switched the balls.</p>
<p>By looking at their colors, you can of course say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if they were the same color and hence indistinguishable, there is no way you could guess correctly with probability higher than 1/2.</p>
<p>If you and your friend repeat this “proof” <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> times (for large <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>), your friend should become convinced that the balls are indeed differently colored; otherwise, the probability that you would have succeeded at identifying all the switch/non-switches is at most <span class="math inline">\(2^{-t}\)</span>. Furthermore, the proof is “zero-knowledge” because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed, he gains no knowledge about how to distinguish the balls.</p>

<p>An example I like is this. I think I heard it from Avi Wigderson but I can’t quite remember. (I don’t know who actually thought of it.) You want to prove that a graph can be properly coloured with three colours. So you draw a picture of the graph and then make six copies of that picture. You then properly colour the vertices with red, blue and green, but you also colour the other five copies of the graph in the same way but permuting the colours (so, for instance, in one of them you colour all vertices red that you previously coloured blue and all vertices blue that you previously coloured red). You now repeatedly do the following. Randomly pick one of your pictures, cover each vertex with a coin (so that its colour cannot be seen) and allow the other person to pick an edge and remove the two coins at its end vertices. The other person will obtain from this the information that those two vertices are coloured differently, but will obtain no other information about the colouring.</p>
<p>Now if there is no proper colouring of the graph, and you keep presenting the other person with colourings of the graph, then they can randomly choose their edges, and sooner or later, with very high probability, they will hit an edge that has the same colour at each end. (For the probability to be high, you need to go for many more steps than there are edges in the graph.) So from the fact that this never happens, they can deduce that with extremely high probability you do in fact have a proper colouring of the graph.</p>

<p>Demonstrating an attack on a cryptosystem is very similar to the colored balls example in Ryan’s answer. Suppose Alice and Bob have a means of communicating messages and Eve wants to prove that it is insecure, without revealing the method used to exploit the system. Alice and Eve can simply agree that Alice will send a sequence of random messages to Bob. If Eve can tell Alice the contents of the messages, then with high probability Eve must have an attack on the cryptosystem.</p>

Another way to obtain the formula is to first consider the derivative of the determinant at the identity: <span class="math display">\[
 \frac{d}{dt} \det (I + t M) = \operatorname{tr} M.
\]</span>
</p>
<p>
Next, one has <span class="math display">\[
\begin{split}
   \frac{d}{dt} \det A (t)
&amp;amp;=\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\det \bigl(A (t + h)\bigr) - \det A (t)}{h}\\
&amp;amp;=\det A (t) \lim_{h \to 0}  \frac{\det \bigl(A (t)^{-1} A (t + h)\bigr) - 1}{h}\\
